If you require write access please read further.\n\nUpdate July 2015 \n\nIt is time to bring this answer a bit more current as some elements of FileGDB support in QGIS have changed.  I am now running QGIS 2.10.0 - Pisa.  It was installed using the OSGeo4W installer.  \n\nWhat has changed is that upon the basic install of QGIS, File GDB read-only access is enabled by default, using the Open FileGDB driver.  Credit for first noting this must be given to @SaultDon.\nRead/Write access may be enabled using the FileGDB driver install through the OGR_FileGDB library.  The library needs to be enabled using the process below, either when you install QGIS, or individually.  More detail about the drivers is below:  \n\n\nFileGDB driver:  Uses the FileDB API SDK from ESRI - Read/Write to FGDB&#39;s of ArcGIS 10 and above  \nOpenFleGDB driver:  Available in GDAL &gt;= 1.11 - Read Only access to FGDB&#39;s of ArcGIS 9 and above\n\n\nWhen you add a Vector Layer, you simply choose the  based on the driver you want to use.\nESRI FileGDB Driver\n\n\nOpen FileGDB Driver\n\n\nThe process below shows in more detail the steps to install QGIS from the OSGeo4W installer, ensure the OGR_FileGDB library is installed, then load layers from a File Geodatabase.\n\n\nDownload and run  for 32bit or  for 64bit from OSGeo4W.\nChoose Advanced Install, then Install from Internet.  Choose your root and local package directories, and then your connection type, in my case, &quot;Direct Connection&quot;.  Once you click next, it will bring up a screen with a number of collapsed menus.\n\nExpand the &quot;Desktop&quot; menu.  Find the entry for &quot;qgis: Quantum GIS (desktop)&quot;.  In the &quot;New&quot; column, change entry from &quot;Skip&quot;, to show version 2.10.0-1.\n\nExpand the &quot;Libs&quot; menu.  Find the entry for &quot;gdal-filegdb: OGR FileGDB Driver&quot;.  In the &quot;New&quot; column, change the entry from &quot;Skip&quot;, to show version 1.11.2-1.\n\nOnce you click Next, it will install QGIS and all of the associated libraries.  Once this is completed, open Quantum GIS, and Choose &quot;Add Vector Data&quot;.  Change the option to &quot;Directory&quot;.  This is where you choose the driver as shown above.\n\nBrowse to the File Geodatabase and select the directory.  Click &quot;Open&quot;\n\nSelect a Vector Layer and press &quot;Ok&quot;.  Please note that the FileGDB API Does not support Raster Images.\n\nAs you can see, the selected layer loads in.  Using the Esri driver, editing is possible.  If you use the Open FileGDB driver, the data is read only.\n\nFor your reference, here is the &quot;About&quot; window from my install of QGIS, showing the versions of the software, and the GDAL/OGR library being used.\n\n\n\nThis install was performed on a Windows 7 64bit computer.  With previous installers, there were some inconsistent results.  This may have changed with the switch to the 32 or 64bit installers.

I would like it if people posted examples of beautiful maps, displaying any phenomena in any manner.\n\nBelow I have posted one of my favorite maps.

This is in particular useful combined with the very &quot;noisy&quot; standardized mortality ratio&#39;s, and the typically very noisy clusters of abnormally high rates produced by the SatScan clustering technique. One can even clearly see very small clusters around Chicago and Philadelphia. \n\nThere are other supplemental elements of the map that make it easy on the eyes. For example, the black background, the heavier white outline for around the states and the white outline for the states (that is blended the same as the attribute values). Maps with many polygons can particularly be distracting if one does not take care when plotting the polygon outlines. \n\nAlso the legend is particularly well created, and effectively demonstrates the concept (although it certainly isn&#39;t a typical legend, so took some original creative thought).\n",

            "body": "I make my living applying mathematics and statistics to solving the kinds of problems a GIS is designed to address.  One can learn to use a GIS effectively without knowing much math at all: millions of people have done it.  But over the years I have read (and responded to) many thousands of questions about GIS and in many of these situations some basic mathematical knowledge, beyond what&#39;s usually taught (and remembered) in high school, would have been a distinct advantage.\n\nThe material that keeps coming up includes the following:\n\n\nTrigonometry and spherical trigonometry.  Let me surprise you: this stuff is overused.  In many cases trig can be avoided altogether by using simpler, but slightly more advanced, techniques, especially basic vector arithmetic.\nElementary differential geometry.  This is the investigation of smooth curves and surfaces.  It was invented by C. F. Gauss in the early 1800&#39;s specifically to support wide-area land surveys, so its applicability to GIS is obvious.  Studying the basics of this field prepares the mind well to understand geodesy, curvature, topographic shapes, and so on.\nTopology.  No, this does not mean what you think it means: the word is consistently abused in GIS.  This field emerged in the early 1900&#39;s as a way to unify otherwise difficult concepts with which people had been grappling for centuries.  These include concepts of infinity, of space, of nearness, of connectedness.  Among the accomplishments of 20th century topology was the ability to describe spaces and calculate with them.  These techniques have trickled down into GIS in the form of vector representations of lines, curves, and polygons, but that merely scratches the surface of what can be done and of the beautiful ideas lurking there.  (For an accessible account of part of this history, read Imre Lakatos&#39; Proofs and Refutations.  This book is a series of dialogs within a hypothetical classroom that is pondering questions that we would recognize as characterizing the elements of a 3D GIS.  It requires no math beyond grade school but eventually introduces the reader to homology theory.)\n\nDifferential geometry and topology also deal with &quot;fields&quot; of geometric objects, including the vector and tensor fields Waldo Tobler has been talking about for the latter part of his career.  These describe extensive phenomena within space, such as temperatures, winds, and crustal movements.\nCalculus. Many people in GIS are asked to optimize something: find the best route, find the best corridor, the best view, the best configuration of service areas, etc.  Calculus underlies all thinking about optimizing functions that depend smoothly on their parameters.  It also offers ways to think about and calculate lengths, areas, and volumes.  You don&#39;t need to know much Calculus, but a little will go a long way.\nNumerical analysis. We often have difficulties solving problems with the computer because we run into limits of precision and accuracy.  This can cause our procedures to take a long time to execute (or be impossible to run) and can result in wrong answers.  It helps to know the basic principles of this field so that you can understand where the pitfalls are and work around them.\nComputer science. Specifically, some discrete mathematics and methods of optimization contained therein.  This includes some basic graph theory, design of data structures, algorithms, and recursion, as well as a study of complexity theory.\nGeometry. Of course.  But not Euclidean geometry: a tiny bit of spherical geometry, naturally; but more important is the modern view (dating to Felix Klein in the late 1800&#39;s) of geometry as the study of groups of transformations of objects.  This is the unifying concept to moving objects around on the earth or on the map, to congruence, to similarity.\nStatistics. Not all GIS professionals need to know statistics, but it is becoming clear that a basic statistical way of thinking is essential.  All our data are ultimately derived from measurements and heavily processed afterwards.  The measurements and the processing introduce errors that can only be treated as random.  We need to understand randomness, how to model it, how to control it when possible, and how to measure it and respond to it in any case.  That does not mean studying t-tests, F-tests, etc; it means studying the foundations of statistics so that we can become effective problem solvers and decision makers in the face of chance.  It also means learning some modern ideas of statistics, including exploratory data analysis and robust estimation as well as principles of constructing statistical models.\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that I am not advocating that all GIS practitioners need to learn all this stuff!  Also, I am not suggesting that the different topics should be learned in isolation by taking separate courses.  This is merely an (incomplete) compendium of some of the most powerful and beautiful ideas that many GIS people would deeply appreciate (and be able to apply) were they to know them.  What I suspect we need is to learn enough about these subjects to know when they might be applicable, to know where to go for help, and to know how to learn more if it should be needed for a project or a job.  From that perspective, taking a lot of courses would be overkill and would likely tax the patience of the most dedicated student.  But for anyone who has an opportunity to learn some mathematics and has a choice of what to learn and how to learn it, this list might provide some guidance.\n",

It\n  should be treated as a special case and should not be viewed as the\n  type of question that is encouraged on this, or any Stack Exchange\n  site, but if you wish to contribute more content to it then feel free\n  to do so by editing this answer.\n\n\n\n\nFor non-GIS background devs creating single-function mapping apps - I&#39;d probably recommend Leaflet (now supported by MapBox). Easy to use and small. More functionality relies on plugins of varying quality and support. \n\nGIS online type application - use OpenLayers3 - has the full suite of data sources, controls etc. in a single library. It can also be used for simple mapping apps, so if you have a mix then I&#39;d use this for everything. \n\nGoogle still has the library/data combination (e.g. StreetView is not available anywhere else). \n\nEsri has GUI web app builders, and as noted below, why complicate things if you already use their stack. \n\nCommercial APIs (Google, Bing, Yahoo)\n\nUsing any commercial API leaves you at the mercy of whatever changes the provider makes to the API or Terms of Service. What happens for example if suddenly your local government portal that uses Google Maps suddenly has adverts popping up all over it? Want to reuse your JavaScript Google Maps code for an Intranet site? You&#39;ll find yourself having to pay the $10,000 licencing fee. \n\nMicrosoft often have more defined and fixed terms for their services (if paying) so there may be less of a risk here. \n\nThe recent backlash against Twitter is a good example of developers having an API that changed beneath them. If you aren&#39;t paying for a service then you (or your system) are the one being sold. \n\nGoogle started charging for use of their maps from October 2011. \n\nEsri\n\nAs others have mentioned if you are using an Esri stack then the ArcGIS API for JavaScript will no doubt work well on top of it. Coming from a GIS background Esri have probably thought more about traditional GIS tasks and features than the &quot;neo-geography&quot; web-giants (though this is just an opinion/feeling). \n\nOpenLayers has built in support for ArcGIS REST layers, and if you are looking to reuse your code for non-ESRI based websites then again an open API serves you best. \n\nUse OpenLayers...\n\nI can&#39;t really think why developers would use an API other than OpenLayers. Open Source projects lead to related Open Source projects so there are a wealth of reusable components out there such as the GeoExt library, MapQuery,  and GeoPrisma. \n\nI&#39;ll just add that just because a project is Open Source does not automatically make it better than commercial equivalents - but the OpenLayers API matches the commercial competition in this case, and the ability to see how the source works, the unit tests, the build scripts etc. mean that you can easily build new features on top of it. \n\nThere has been some recent criticism of OpenLayers, mainly related to complexity, styling, and size. There have been counter-arguments made to these here and here by Christopher Schmidt one of the lead developers of OpenLayers. \n\nIt is worth noting that if you need a simple Open Source mapping API then take a look at Cloudmade&#39;s Leaflet. \n\nThe comment smaller, faster, newer, and more straightforward can also be read as less features and less tested.\n\nScan the API documentation for Leaflet and OpenLayers. The latter includes items such as WFS layers, editing tools, and SLD support. It has also been tested in many different environments, and works in IE6 (allowing government and local authority users). \n\nFor simpler display of spatial data Leaflet looks ideal, and easier to get started. However I&#39;ll be sticking with OpenLayers for more feature-rich GIS applications. \n\nCaveats\n\nOne possible downside is often new innovations are seen first in commercial providers&#39; systems - however these nearly always filter through to OpenLayers in time. \n\nFinally I&#39;m sure there are certain scenarios where other APIs are more suitable - on custom hardware, to fit in with an organisations other IT systems, or if you already know an API inside-out and can get a system developed in half the time. \n\nAll the APIs you mentioned are capable of producing great online mapping systems, but your choice should also fit in with you or your company&#39;s future development needs. \n",

            "body": "What is Lanczos resampling?\nAlthough the theory is described in an early paper and the Wikipedia article, a &quot;feel&quot; for resampling methods is best obtained by computing them on simple or standard images.  This can be a vast topic, requiring extensive experimentation, but some simplifications are available:\n\nThese operators work separately in each color channel.  Therefore it suffices to study how they work on a monochromatic (&quot;black and white&quot;) image.\n\nMost convolution operators used in image processing work the same way in the x and y directions and independently in both directions.  In effect, they are really one dimensional operators applied first to the rows and then to the columns.  This means we can study them by studying &quot;1D&quot; images, which can be plotted in detail.\n\nEverything we need to know about a linear operator (which includes all convolution operators) can be inferred from how an operator works on the simplest non-constant image of all: this is a sudden jump from one value to another.\n\n\nLet&#39;s look at an illustration of several popular resampling methods.  Actually, we need two illustrations: one to show what happens in &quot;downsampling,&quot; where the new image is coarser than the old, and another to look at &quot;upsampling,&quot; where the new images is  refinement of the old.  Let&#39;s start with the latter, because it shows more detail.\nUpsampling\n\nThe original 7 by 7 image on the left is really one-dimensional because each row is the same.  The resampling occurs across the columns.  The dimension of the other five images is 80 by 80, showing in detail how each method interpolates between the original coarse pixels.  Nearest-neighbor sampling retains the sharp division between dark and light while the other four methods blur the intervening region to some extent.  Notably, the Lanczos resampler creates some regions that are darker than any in the original and others that are lighter than any in the original.  (This can have implications for GIS work, because such an extrapolation of the original values can potentially cause the new values to be invalid.  They can also extend beyond the range of the original color map, sometimes causing the extreme values in the resampling image to be rendered incorrectly.  This is a problem with bicubic convolution resampling in ArcGIS, for example.)\n(NB: The &quot;bicubic&quot; method shown here is a bicubic spline, not the &quot;bicubic convolution&quot; of ArcGIS.)\nUsing lightness to depict image values, although natural, is not very precise.  The next illustration rectifies this by graphing the cell values (vertical axis) by column (horizontal axis).\n\nLower values on the graphs correspond to darker parts of the images.  A thoughtful examination of the original uncovers a hidden assumption: although the original image looks like a sharp jump from dark to light, the jump actually occurs over one-seventh (1/7) of the extent of the columns.  Who is to say what really happens in that interval in the original scene the image is depicting?  We therefore should not be too critical of differences among the resampling methods that occur within this short interval: each one is giving a different but potentially equally valid rendering of what might be occurring in the original scene.  In this sense, it is no longer apparent that nearest neighbor sampling is the most faithful interpolation method.\nOne conclusion we should draw is that the accuracy of any upsampling method depends on the nature of the underlying scene.  If the scene consists of values that should smoothly vary from one point to the next, then the nearest neighbor method is likely to be the least faithful way of resampling among those shown.\nDownsampling\n\nHere we see the result of downsampling a 16 by 16 image to 8 by 8 images (a 2 by 2 aggregation).  Nearest neighbor accurately retains the sharp boundary.  Lanczos differs from the others by enhancing the apparent sharpness.  A close look shows that it darkens the dark area on one side of the boundary and lightens the light area on the other side.  The graphs clarify this:\n\nThe bilinear, bicubic, and Gaussian resamplers show characteristics of convolution operators that have all positive weights (or very small negative weights): they average, or &quot;smear,&quot; neighboring values.  In downsampling this causes sharp features to be blurred.  The extent of the blur depends on the width of the kernel.  Like these others, the Lanczos resampler also blurs the jump, but it &quot;overshoots&quot; it on both sides.  That&#39;s the contrast enhancement seen just above in the images themselves.  Because of this tendency to increase contrast (the local differences between the highs and lows in the image), the Lanczos resampler is often called a &quot;sharpening filter.&quot;  These graphs show that this characterization requires a nuanced understanding, because evidently it does not actually reduce the averaging of values on both sides of the jump.  At pixel 4, its value of 0.56 is comparable to the values computed by the other convolution filters.\nHow does using it affect the output?\nLet&#39;s take a look at what happens in a more complex image.\n\nThe original, which is a 13 by 13 image now includes a pattern with the highest possible spatial frequency (alternating between light and dark with every column at the right).  We cannot hope to reproduce such features when downsampling: the smaller amount of pixels simply cannot hold all this information.  Let&#39;s focus, then, on what happens when such an image is upsampled.  If we care about faithful reproduction of the scene, we will want this high-frequency pattern to be reproduced accurately.\nThe smaller images are resampled to 25 by 25 pixels: almost, but not quite, a 2:1 refinement.  To my eye, the Lanczos and bilinear methods reproduce the stripes most sharply among the four convolution resamplers.  Nearest neighbor is, of course, the most faithful (because it cannot average values at all).\n\nThese graphs of the same results show that the Lanczos resampler was able to maintain the contrast in the stripes (as seen by the size of the vertical swings from lows to highs) at the expense of introducing a variation of intensity within the constant-value light area in the middle of the image (pixels 5, 6, 7 of the original).  This variation shows up as stripe-like artifacts within the light part of the image (the middle).  Of the resamplers shown here, it is alone in introducing such spurious detail.\nWhat is it useful for in a spatial application?\nEvidently, Lanczos resampling is not a panacea or omnibus solution to resampling.  It is superior to many other convolution resamplers in maintaining (or even enhancing) local contrast.  This can be useful when the resampled image is intended for viewing identification of detailed features or boundaries.  When the resampled image will subsequently be analyzed or processed, Lanczos resampling may increase the ability to detect edges and linear features.\nWhen the resampled image will be analyzed in other ways, though, the benefits of Lanczos resampling are doubtful.  It typically will (artificially) increase local measures of spatial variability, such as focal ranges and focal standard deviations.  It will not affect spatial means on the whole--like the other convolution resamplers, it is usually normalized (which means it&#39;s a local weighted average, with no bias introduced)--but it may increase some local averages and decrease others compared to the other resamplers.\nThe (necessarily brief) evaluation here suggests the Lanczos resampler generally should not be used for downsampling: for that application, it appears to offer nothing that simpler (and more commonly available) methods have, which retaining the potential disadvantage of extrapolating beyond the original range of data values.\nAfterword: a general comment\nThe investigation described here is an example of what anybody can do when they have a question about how a GIS operation works.  It uses the GIS itself as the subject of the investigation: to know what some operation or analytical method does, simply apply it under controlled experimental conditions.  In this case that amounts to constructing simple test images, resampling them according to available methods, and examining the results.\nThere are three critical aspects of this approach to learning about how GIS works:\n\nTheory.  The experimentation usually cannot be done &quot;blind&quot;: it helps to know some theory.  We don&#39;t usually need to know much, but we need the basics.  In this case, the theory of convolutions greatly reduced the number and types of images that we need to experiment with.  We didn&#39;t need to know anything about Fourier analysis, etc.  (Make no mistake, such knowledge is beneficial.  But lack of specialized knowledge of this sort shouldn&#39;t stop us.)\nPractice.  By using our GIS itself to perform the experiment, we are able to see what it actually does.  This avoids disconnects between theory (which tells us what the software should do) and practice (which is what it really does).\nQuantification.  Unless the question concerns visual perception, for evaluating the results we should not rely solely on looking at maps (or, in this case, images). To get the best information, we need to quantify the output (done here with graphs) and, often, describe and summarize it with statistical methods.\n\n",

When I want to calculate the distance between students and the schools they attend, I call a distance function on my geometry column, but also wrap a ST_Transform function around the geometry column first to &#39;project&#39; the data into State Plane CO Central (SRID: 2877). This gives me a column for the distance of each student to their closest school in feet because SRID:2877 is a projected coordinate system that stores data in Feet.\n\nSo my recommendation for you would be to store your data in a Geometry (data type) column in SRID 4326 (as oppose to a geography data type which does not support projections / transformations).\n",

There is a little trick which is to use PostgreSQL&#39;s distinct operator, which will return the first match of each combination -- as you are ordering by ST_Distance, effectively it will return the closest point from each senal to each port.\n\nIf you know that the minimum distance in each case is no more than some amount x, (and you have a spatial index on your tables), you can speed this up by putting a , eg, if all the minumum distances are known to be no more than 10km, then:\n\nObviously, this needs to be used with caution, as if the minimum distance is greater, you will simply get no row for that combination of senal and port.\nThe order by order must match the distinct on order, which makes sense, as distinct is taking the first distinct group based on some ordering.\nIt is assumed that you have a spatial index on both tables.\nThere is another option, which is to use PostgreSQL&#39;s &lt;-&gt; and &lt;#&gt; operators, (center point and bounding box distance calculations, respectively) which make more efficient use of the spatial index and don&#39;t require the ST_DWithin hack to avoid n^2 comparisons. There is a good blog article explaining how they work. The general thing to note is that these two operators work in the ORDER BY clause.\n\n\nAs this question has received a lot of attention and k-nearest neighbours (kNN) is generally a hard problem (in terms of algorithmic run-time) in GIS, it seems worthwhile to expand somewhat on the original scope of this question.\nThe standard way for find the x nearest neighbours of one object is to use a LATERAL JOIN (conceptually similar to a for each loop). Borrowing shamelessly from @dbaston&#39;s answer, you would do something like:\n\nSo, if you want to find the nearest 10 ports, ordered by distance, you simply have to change the LIMIT clause in the lateral sub-query. This is much harder to do without LATERAL JOINS and involves using ARRAY type logic.\nWhile this approach works well, it can be sped up enormously if you know you only have to search out to a given distance. In this instance, you can use ST_DWithin(signs.geom, ports.geom, 1000) in the subquery, which because of the way indexing works with the &lt;-&gt; operator -- one of the geometries should be a constant, rather than a column reference -- may be much faster. So, for example, to get the 3 nearest ports, within 10km, you could write something like the following.\n\nAs always, usage will vary depending on your data distribution and queries, so EXPLAIN is your best friend.\nFinally, there is a minor gotcha, if using LEFT instead of CROSS JOIN LATERAL in that you have to add ON TRUE after the lateral queries alias, eg,\n\n",

            "body": "I use my intuitive &quot;rules of thumb&quot;... It is useful for a rapid decision,\n\nAbout your DATABASE: if features and/or spatial analysis are of continental-scale, and need precision (serious applications) use geography. Else use geometry: when all database is about same (city-scale) region, or you not need precision, etc. you need only geometry. See similar rule at the suggest lecture of  @underdark.\n\nAbout your needs in terms of PERFORMANCE/PRECISION  BALANCE: geometry is faster; if you need performance and think to use geography, do your benchmarks first.\n\n\n\nKey-concepts\nOn this page, we see some key-words and the focus on some concepts: precision, performance, and something like flexibility/commodity of use.\nAs remembered by others, the difference, for store and calculations, is the use of sphere in geography and plane in geometry:\n\nthe sphere (geography) is better, more precise. See the Los Angeles/Paris example.\nevolution of geography: as @DavidF say, &quot;geography type was more recently added, so fewer functions are supported/implemented&quot;.\n\nPerhaps on the year 2020 all GIS databases will be set to the same standard SRID/EPSG (equivalent to the nowadays 4326 code, for WGS84).\nToday geography is not a default choice because of performance and functional limitations.\nDiscussion\nIn my opinion it is a question of &quot;best practices&quot;, not a deep technical/theoretical problem.\nPrecision\nAfter estimate the error on your data, do your tests and compare results: the precision gains with geography are higher than error of data? The ST_Distance function (with MAX and AVG aggregators) is the main reference in this kind of experiment.\nPerformance\nExamples of benchmarks in an urban area of ~100km2 (diameter ~11km), all stored as geometry, in a planar UTM coordinate system. NOTE: starting with the frequently used geometry/geography conversion \u2014 frequently because some functions not exist and some others, like ST_Buffer and ST_Intersection, do conversion internally.\nBench#1: a table with ~87000 polygons representing urban lots, each with poly with (avg) ~13 points,\n\nso, geography_time=6*geometry_time.\nBench#2: a table with ~3500 polygons representing urban blocks, each with poly with (avg) ~50 points:  0.6s vs 2.7s, geography_time=4.5*geometry_time.\nBench#3: ~10000 lines representing urban streets, each with ~5 points. ~0.87s vs ~0.36s, geography_time=2.4*geometry_time.\nBack to Bench#2, creating the tables and doing queries,\n\nConclusion: for little tasks and good hardaware, the times converge to the &quot;acceptable-same time&quot;, but for big tasks, there are performance ratings to consider.\nFlexibility/Commodity\nOn the benchmarks I do a day-by-day task, checking the number of points (by )... It is an example of operation that not exists for geography, needs cast. The &quot;geography/geometry cast&quot; is an annoying task for programmers, masters, etc.\nWhen reusing libraries of SQL and PL/pgSQL functions, geography need adaptations. And, if you want to optimize code, or avoid precision problems with a lot of intermediary conversions, the absence of a complete set of build-in functions, with geography, is another problem. Program for geography, is not a easy task.\nProcess-only, data interchange, etc.\nFor non-usual demand, with no intensive user like Mapserver, when your only (PostGIS) work is to process input data and return at any time (like hours or days) the processed data, the rule of thumb is &quot;use geography if you are comfortable!&quot; (see &quot;Flexibility/Commodity&quot; above).  If not, check usual rules.\nNOTE: of course, if your (non-usual) task is only  show data from PostGIS to Mapserver, with no process need,  to preserve the same (geometry or geography) of your input data, is better decision.\nI believe the data centralization is another task where geography is better: in context where the diversity of input formats and reference systems are usual, the use of a standard, such as that enforced by the geography, is beneficial... Convention over configuration is a good principle when centralization and data interchange are the business focus (see Google Maps!).\n",

            "body": "This is a topic that always comes up. I may not have the right answer, but I can give you my personal opinion.\n\nThe reason that they are supported, can be attributed to several characteristics about them, so let me mention a few.\n\n\nFirst, there is a spec. I mean, I am in my early thirties and this thing existed since I was a teenager. So it is safe to say that this spec has been around for some time. Of course, there are several other formats that are also published, but the difference about this one is that...\nIt is relatively simple! It is built on top of the DBF Format, which at the time already existed and was widely supported in several platforms/OSs. There were already parsers that could read half of this format (the DBF part), so it made supporting the extra addition easier. You have a geometry? Sure just serialize it and write it. You are done. Contrast this with a coverage! Try to explain to somebody in simple terms what a topology clean does. It is not trivial to write a topologically clean coverage.\nMost importantly, I think the #1 reason for shapefiles to still be popular is that they are supported in both Open Source and Proprietary systems alike. What GIS do you know that doesn&#39;t support shapefiles?!? Unheard of. \n\n\nAs a replacement, we hear of File GeoDatabases and Spatialite. Both formats, are vastly superior in terms of functionality, flexibility, speed, etc. when compared to Shapefiles. In their own way, they have certain things that make them better than each other in different areas, but a comparison of spatialite and FileGDB is certainly out of the scope of this question. \n\nDo I think that either of this formats will replace Shapefiles? Not in their current incarnations. \n\nWhy?\n\nNot because of a technological argument (I did say they were superior in that aspect after all), but because of something else: licensing.\n\nSo what are their problems?\n\nFileGDB:\n\nFileGDB provides interoperability through the new FileGDB API. Nevertheless, this API is provided in binary format by ESRI. This is not a specification. Having worked in the GeoDatabase team in the past, I can tell you, contrary to all the tin-foil-hat-wearing conspiracy theorists, this is not malicious at all. It is because the internals of the GeoDatabase change on every release. Publishing a full spec would entail basically giving all the details of how everything is supposed to be maintained and then carefully documenting the changes to the format with every yearly release. It doesn&#39;t make sense. So the FileGDB API, even though it is not a spec, it abstracts out all those little changes. And now it can be used cross-platform! Mind you, this is a huge step forward! Considering the conservative nature of ESRI, this is definitely a reaction in the right direction.\n\nAnd yet, binary-only support doesn&#39;t make anybody in the Open Source world too happy. How do you then take advantage of porting some code to say to some other flavor of Linux if ESRI doesn&#39;t support it. You can&#39;t. This is what makes Open Source powerful, and now, you cannot take advantage of this. If ESRI decides to stop supporting Debian, that&#39;s it. You are done. And there is nothing you can do to change it. \n\nSpatialite:\n\nSpatialite is awesome because it gets all the free functionality from SQLite. SQLite is used everywhere. It is on your Android Phone, on your iPhone/iPad, on Firefox, on Google Chrome, on several commercial embedded devices - can go on forever. To truly make it into a Geoformat (and not just do dumb bounding box operations), it needs to leverage the same geometry library that PostGIS uses: GEOS. Sadly, GEOS is based on another even more awesome geometry library known as JTS. All the algorithms in JTS are extremely powerful, so what is the problem?\n\nWell, JTS is licensed as Open Source LGPL, and LGPL is a viral license. JTS is LGPL, means GEOS is LGPL, means spatialite linked statically with GEOS is LGPL. This sucks. Why? Without explaining open source licenses too much, I can tell you that, for example, I cannot use spatialite on, say, an iPhone app because that would make my entire app automatically open source (iOS only allows static linking). Any type of GPL license (reasonably) scares the crap out of ESRI, and so they will not touch it with a 10 foot pole. Hence, ArcGIS, the most popular GIS system in the world does not (and will probably never) support spatialite natively. This automatically kills it as a viable format.\n\nAnd thus we go back to crappy shapefiles that are supported everywhere.\n\nUpdate: \n\nApparently my answer was controversial enough that someone decided it was OK to freely edit and change the entire meaning of my answer to put their point of view. Please don&#39;t do that. If you disagree with me, that is completely fine, just post your opinion in a different answer and let the community decide. I rolled backed the edits to my answer to show the original meaning. I am adding this update in case you read the edited answer that claimed that sqlite was a viable format.\n",

            "body": "This Q&amp;A was pointed out to me and I thought I could assist by providing a little transparency about ArcGIS Professional.   I look after the teams responsible for ArcMap, ArcGlobe, ArcScene, ArcGIS Engine,  and the new ArcGIS Professional application.   Firstly,  it\u2019s an active development project and many important decisions both technical and business related are yet to be made.   And,  you can help make them,  our team spoke with many folks at the Esri 2013 User Conference who got hands on with ArcGIS Pro,  and gave us great feedback \u2013 if you were one of them,  thanks!   But providing your ideas, thoughts / feedback through ideas.arcgis.com,  your Esri account reps,  by participating in our Early Adaptor or beta programs and forums like this all are good ways to give us guidance as we progress.\n\nIs ArcGIS Professional a replacement for ArcMap, ArcGlobe and ArcScene?  No.    ArcGIS Pro is a brand new application,  with brand new opportunity to help users solve real problems, that can benefit from multiple 2D and 3D views allowing visualization and editing in both environments, for example.   Apparently my choice of words in my demo of the software during the plenary was unclear about it \u201crunning with Desktop,\u201d sorry for that confusion,  I should have been more clear about the side by side capability of existing Desktop applications and ArcGIS Pro.    They simply can run side by side on the same machine,  not sharing registry keys...etc.\n\nOur vision was to take the most commonly used functionality from these three separate Desktop applications (ArcMap/Globe/Scene) and merge it into one application \u2013 support for both 2D and 3D views is the obvious benefit and example here.    But ArcMap/Globe/Scene will stay current and maintained, with new functionality to be delivered through these applications for the long term.  I think ArcGIS 10.2 was a good example of this,  read the what\u2019s new document carefully,  a lot of great new capability went into 10.2.   When ArcGIS Professional is released,  the current Desktop applications will be updated and ship too.   Will there be a day when someone will only use ArcGIS Professional,  and not ArcMap \u2013 maybe \u2013 but it\u2019s up to that person, and their workflows to make that decision based on the capability of ArcGIS Professional.   It won\u2019t be because our team stops shipping ArcMap/ArcGlobe/ArcScene in the foreseeable future.    We are hard at work with the 10.2.1 release now for these applications.\n\nArcGIS Pro is a completely new WPF based application, it\u2019s not java anything,  it\u2019s not based on ArcGIS Runtime either.    The important thing is has great performance, and the application remains responsive all the time, it does not block the UI as can happen in single threaded applications.  This of course is achieved through a multi-threaded (64 bit) application framework that can take advance of large memory address space and GPU\u2019s for display performance.    The 2D parts of the graphics engine have been shipping in several releases of ArcGIS,  the 3D capability has not been released previously, and is new and very fast.  Our Graphics team has many years invested in this engine,  and we\u2019re excited to be getting close to shipping it soon.  This 3D graphics engine is not based on CityEngine,  but the CityEngine runtime is utilized in the application for 3D representations, for example, and will continue to be used for 3D innovation going forward,  a good example of this is our Solution for 3D Cities and Campuses. \nLicensing levels is another topic that questions are being asked about.   \n\nAs I said in the road ahead sessions at the 2013 UC,  we have not made all final (business) decisions here.   But our goal is to simplify licensing where we can,  and make sure it\u2019s in alignment with ArcGIS.com and new simpler subscription models we are releasing now for the ArcGIS Platform.   Also simplifying the access and update of software, through web downloads is what we are working on.   We will provide status as we make progress on these important decisions. \nI hope this helps you understand not just some higher level motivation and vision, but also a bit of the technical architecture of ArcGIS Professional we have implemented so far.\n\nArcGIS Professional Extensibility.   Here are our current thoughts about extensibility for ArcGIS Pro.  You can write and run Python scripts in ArcGIS that call geoprocessing tools and use an exhaustive suite of scripting functions available in the ArcGIS Python API, ArcPy, to automate your GIS tasks. Your scripts can also use a diverse array of functions provided through Python\u2019s standard and 3rd party libraries.\n\nYou can leverage the considerable capabilities of the .NET framework and WPF to extend the application with functionality involving interactive scenarios and rich user interface aspects.  Both of these types of customizations are accomplished using the well-known Add-In model.\n\n.NET Developers can code against a simplified object model that\u2019s easier to understand and use than the COM based interfaces in the ArcObjects API.  The .NET API is modern, language specific.\n\nArcGIS Professional will run \u201cstand alone\u201d like current Desktop applications and ArcGIS Runtime Apps.   But we are also really trying to invite the Desktop users to leverage the ArcGIS Platform as a whole if it makes sense for them.   We created this Professional GIS site with this in mind http://pro.arcgis.com/\n\nWe see this site as a consolidated wealth of information for GIS Professionals,  but also an opportunity to be exposed to brand new capability in the ArcGIS Platform in an integrated way, with the goal of helping you leverage the Platform better to solve the real problems. \n",

Some of the more well known ones are: QGIS, GeoServer, and OpenLayers.\n\nBeing part of OSGeo gives a project some support, through assistance with governance, and potentially funding. But it also gives a project some legitimacy and assurance. Being part of OSGeo means the project has a team of core developers, a roadmap on where the project is going, and some form of governance.\n\nYou can be confident using Open Source GIS software because it has this support network through OSGeo.\n\nOSGeo4W:\n\nOSGeo4W is a windows installer for Open Source GIS projects. The nature of Open Source means that many project/programs rely on eachother for features. A great example of this is GDAL. GDAL is used to some extent by practically all Open Source GIS projects to read and write data. But because Windows, being a closed platform, it has not developed a package manager like Unix based operating systems. So if you install GRASS and QGIS using their stand-alone installers, you end up with 2 installs of GDAL. Add 3 or 4 more Open Source installs and you can end up with a dozen installs of GDAL, in addition an install just for GDAL.\n\nThis is where OSGeo4W comes in. It can keep track of the shared requirements of Open Source GIS packages, so QGIS and GRASS can share a single install of GDAL. It also keeps track of versions so you can simply upgrade programs.\n",

            "body": "Every polygon has, at a minimum, four distinct &quot;centers&quot;:\n\n\nThe barycenter of its vertices.\nThe barycenter of its edges.\nIts barycenter as a polygon.\nA GIS-specific &quot;center&quot; useful for labeling (usually calculated with undocumented proprietary methods).\n\n\n(They may accidentally coincide in special cases, but for &quot;generic&quot; polygons they are distinct points.)\n\nA &quot;barycenter&quot; in general is a &quot;center of mass.&quot;  The three types differ on where the mass is presumed located: it either is entirely on the vertices, spread uniformly on the edges, or spread uniformly throughout the polygon itself.\n\nSimple methods exist to compute all three barycenters.  One approach relies on the basic fact that the barycenter of the disjoint union of two masses is the total-mass-weighted average of the barycenters.  From this we easily obtain the following:\n\n\nThe barycenter of two (equally weighted) vertices is their average.  This is obtained by averaging their coordinates separately.  Geometrically, it is the midpoint of the line segment joining the two vertices.\nInductively, the barycenter of n (equally weighted) vertices is obtained by averaging their coordinates separately.\nThe barycenter of a line segment is its midpoint.  (This is clear by symmetry.)\nThe barycenter of a polyline is obtained by finding the midpoints of each line segment and then forming their weighted average using the segment lengths as weights.\n\nFor example, consider the &quot;L&quot; shape delineated by the points (0,0), (6,0), (6,12).  There are two segments: one of length 6 with midpoint at ( (0+0)/2, (0+6)/2 ) = (3,0) and another of length 12 with midpoint at ( (6+6)/2, (0+12)/2 ) = (6,6).  Their length-weighted average coordinates are therefore (x,y) with\n\n\n\nThis differs from the barycenter of the three vertices, which is ( (0+6+6)/3, (0+0+12)/3 ) = (4,4).\n\n(Edit As another example, consider the figure in the question, which although square in shape, is represented as a pentagon determined by the sequence of points (0,0), (1/2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1).  The five sides have lengths 1/2, 1/2, 1, 1, 1 and midpoints (1/4,0), (3/4,0), (1,1/2), (1/2,1), and (0,1/2), respectively.  Their weighted average therefore equals\n\n\n\nas one would hope, even though the barycenter of the vertices alone (computed as in #2 above) is (0.5, 0.4).)\nThe barycenter of a polygon can be obtained by triangulation to decompose it into triangles.  The barycenter of a triangle-qua-polygon coincides with the barycenter of its vertices.  The area-weighted average of these barycenters is the polygon&#39;s barycenter.  Triangle areas are readily computed in terms of their vertex coordinates (e.g., in terms of the wedge product of two of the sides).  For an illustration of such area calculations, including how to exploit signed (positive or negative) areas, see the section on &quot;Area&quot; at my (old) course notes page.\n\n(Edit Consider the polygon depicted in the question for example.  We could triangulate it with triangles ((0,0), (1/2,0), (0,1)) on the left, ((0,1), (1/2,0), (1,1)) in the middle, and ((1,1), (1,0), (1/2,0)) on the right.  Their areas are 1/4, 1/2, 1/4 respectively and their barycenters--obtained by averaging their vertices--are (1/6,1/3), (1/2,2/3), and (5/6,1/3), respectively.  The area-weighted average of these barycenters equals\n\n\n\nas it should, despite the presence of that fifth vertex along the bottom edge.)\n\n\nIt is evident that each of these methods is efficient: it requires just a single pass over the &quot;spaghetti&quot; representation of the polygon, using (fairly little) constant time at each step.  Note that in all cases except the first (of pure vertices), more information than just a list of vertex coordinates is needed: you need to know the topology of the figure as well.  In the &quot;L&quot; example, we needed to know that (0,0) was connected to (6,0) and not to (6,12), for instance.\n\nThese are all Euclidean concepts.  They can be extended to the sphere (or ellipsoid) in several ways.  A straightforward one views the features as a simplicial complex in three (Euclidean) dimensions, computes the appropriate barycenter, and then projects it outward from the center of the ellipsoid back to the surface.  This requires no new concepts or formulas; you only have to work with a third (z) coordinate in addition to the first two coordinates.  (Areas are still found using lengths of wedge products.)\n\nAnother generalization recognizes that the Euclidean metric--the square root of a sum of squares, according to Pythagoras--can be changed to other Lp metrics for p &gt;= 1: you take the pth root of the sum of pth powers.  Finding appropriate &quot;barycenters&quot; is no longer so simple, because the beautiful additive properties exploited above (barycenters are weighted averages of barycenters of simpler parts of a figure) no longer hold in general.  Often, iterative approximate numerical solutions have to be obtained.  They might not even be unique.\n\nAdditional centers can be defined for various purposes.  Triangles have many different centers that can generalize (somewhat) to polygons: the center of the circumcircle, the center of (some) maximal incircle, the center of a minimum-area bounding ellipse, and others.  Any set can be enclosed in various &quot;hulls,&quot; such as the convex hull, and the centers of those hulls obtained.\n\nNote that many of these &quot;centers&quot; are not necessarily located within the interior of a polygon.  (Any reasonable center of a convex polygon will lie within its interior, though.)\n\nThis variety of approaches and solutions indicates one should be wary of a generic term like &quot;center of geometry&quot; or merely &quot;center&quot;: it could be just about anything.\n",

            "body": "A clarification to the question indicates that methods of resampling a raster are sought.  Many are in use in imaging and photographic communities.  For GIS work, though, several straightforward methods are in common use:\n\n\nNearest-neighbor resampling.  Each cell in the new raster is assigned the value of the nearest cell (center to center) in the original raster.  Use this for categorical data like land use and other classifications.\nBilinear interpolation.  Each cell in the new raster is assigned an average based on the four nearest original cells.  The averaging is linear in the horizontal and vertical directions.  (The resulting formula, though, is not linear; it&#39;s actually quadratic.)  This is good for general-purpose smoothing but the averaging that goes on typically clips local peaks and valleys a bit.\nCubic convolution.  This is similar in spirit to bilinear interpolation but can slightly extrapolate values from nearby cells.  It does so in a way intended to reproduce local averages and variability in the new grid; in particular, the clipping of local extrema should not be as severe.  (One untoward consequence, evident as a bug in ESRI&#39;s ArcGIS, is that the values in the new grid may extend beyond the range of the old one, causing some of the new extremes not to be rendered correctly.  But this is a matter of data display only.)  The tradeoff is that cubic convolution takes a little more time to compute than bilinear interpolation.\n\n\nI discuss the latter two methods in some detail at http://www.quantdec.com/SYSEN597/GTKAV/section9/map_algebra.htm\n\nFor quick one-off calculations I am usually content to perform bilinear interpolation (for continuous data) or nearest-neighbor interpolation (for categorical data).  For all others, especially when preparing master datasets or when anticipating extensive manipulations, I recommend using cubic convolution (as well as giving some thought to ordering the operations to minimize propagation of floating point error).\n",

The business I am at wants to target writing complete solutions that involve GIS as it would benefit their hardware sales. They do not know which market they want to target but want me to pick the GIS software to use, yet I am very green to GIS markets. All i know if target platforms are windows, windows mobile, android and web applications. The idea of mobile applications means data connection is not 100% so internet based services may need to be ruled out, i.e. GoogleMaps.\n\nI was struggling to work out how to phrase this as a question, given the huge range of GIS products available, Esri&#39;s ArcGIS for Desktop, CadCorp, MapInfo, GoogleMap/Earth, qGIS, Manifold, openJump, openstreetmap etc.\n\nTo avoid the what do I buy question, I instead ask the question why do you use Esri ArcGIS. From my experience its slow to navigate around maps and quite verbose to program in causing quite a lead time in development. Esri is also the most expensive product on the market, and i believe also the most popular. But why do people continue to use it, when other systems like CadCorp have the same functionality if not more, seem to be more responsive, can import Esri data and cost less.\n\nI feel that I must be overlooking something here. I know client demands in some industries like defense, want Esri but why is it still so popular, given I often hear how other products are betters (Is this a Windows vs. Mac example on market share vs. quality)\n\nP.s.

A circle is the lowest ratio, but cannot form a continuous grid, and hexagons are the closest shape to a circle that can still form a grid.\nAlso, if you are working over a larger area, a square grid will suffer more from distortion due to curvature than shapes like hexagons.\n\nThere are a number of tools and extensions for creating and using hex grids for ecological/landscape analysis, Patch analyst (Rempel et al., 2003) being a good example, that also provides a large volume of landscape metric measurement capacity. The former Hawth&#39;s Tools, now redesigned as the Geospatial Modeling Environment has a wide array of tools that were developed to fill in gaps in arcgis functionality, including repeating grids.\nA number of third-party extensions have been made for this sort of thing, usually by the researchers who need them, so they frequently don&#39;t have the resources to rebuild their products after every new GIS version is released, so it often seems like there is nothing available\n\nThis paper (Birch, 2007) also presents a thorough comparison of rectangular and hexagonal grids for ecological applications, showing how hexagonal grids are preferable when issues of connectivity, nearest neighbourhood or movement paths are crucial aspects to be considered in the analysis.\n",

Predictor is only useful with  and  compression, the option has no effect with other methods. \n\n\n\nThe predictor savings can be dramatic. I just re-compressed a directory of 16bit geotiff elevation models using up 17GB with the default LZW settings into just 5GB with predictor=2.\n\nThere is conflicting info on the differences between predictors 2 &amp; 3 and when each is best applied (ref1, ref2). Perhaps fuel for another question. \n\nAnother easy option for savings is . There are some software which can&#39;t read tiled images, but those are becoming rarer and mostly outside of GIS (I don&#39;t know of any main stream GIS software now that doesn&#39;t read them).\n\nTo build on @alfonx&#39;s answer of using compressed overviews: This allows the base image to be stored lossless, for data integrity, and the pyramids to be lossy, for speed and some space savings. It&#39;s almost the best of both worlds. For the smallest possible overviews with  on RGB images: use jpeg compression, averaged or gaussian resampling instead of the default nearest neighbour (makes the overviews smoother), and YCBCR photometric overview. See the gdaladdo reference page for more info on these options (though it doesn&#39;t say much about what photometric is all about).\n\nThis is part of a windows batch file I use to apply external jpeg overviews to all tiffs in a directory:\n\n\n\nNotes \n\nGDAL 1.6.0 introduced  resampling which can lead to better results  in case of sharp edges with high contrast or noisy patterns. Powers of 2 levels (2 4 8 ...) should be used so a 3x3 resampling Gaussian kernel is selected.\n\n - if not specified the default of 75% is used, which does yield smaller file, but I find 85% a better compromise in the size vs quality trade off.\n\nUpdate, 2015: GDAL 1.8 and 2.0 have introduced a lot of new options not covered here and which I haven&#39;t had time to digest.

            "body": "If your software doesn&#39;t support multi-part features you may have to go to extraordinary and complicated lengths to execute spatial operations.  For example, the intersection of two polygons can, in general, have more than one connected component.  It is convenient, both algorithmically and conceptually, to suppose that such an intersection returns a single object (a multipart polygon) rather than an arbitrary number of polygons.  (For the same reasons it is helpful to support various forms of null and degenerate features--for example, polygons having an extent but zero area or even polygons with locations but neither extent nor area.  These things can arise from geometric operations; supporting them eliminates a lot of fussy case-by-case post-processing and can prevent useful information from disappearing.)\n\nFrom a relational database point of view, multipart features make normalization possible: when an attribute is inseparable from a collection of polygons, you want to represent that collection as a single object.  A good example would be a feature representing almost any country in the world having a coastline, because the country probably includes some islands.  Do you really want to force your RDBMS to make one copy of the country&#39;s attributes for every little island?  Most likely not.  You don&#39;t even want (or need) to maintain multiple copies of a pointer to the attributes, either.\n\nHow would you represent a network or a branching tree if not as a coordinated multi-polyline?\n\nFrom the point of view of mathematics or algorithmic data structures, allowing a multipart feature is a simplification, not a complication.  In order to support multiply connected polygons (rings and polygons with &quot;holes&quot;) you already need the apparatus for representing multi-part polygons.\n\nFinally, &quot;vector&quot; objects and their typical &quot;spaghetti representation&quot; have their origin in the theory of simplicial complexes.  (It is only through this somewhat tenuous connection to the theory of topology that the term &quot;topology&quot; made it into GIS, which otherwise uses essentially nothing from that theory.)  That theory requires, and benefits from, multi-part features.  In fact, having just a single component is not part of the definition of a simplicial complex, but rather turns out to be a special property enjoyed by some of them (as detected by the rank of their zeroth homology group).  As such, &quot;single part&quot; is not a defining property, but is just a topological quality in the same sense that having a ring or a &quot;hole&quot; in a polygon is a topological quality (related to the rank of the first homology group).\n",

            "body": "Firstly - this is an excellent question (+1).  As a freelancer, I wish I had had this information when I started out!\n\nSecondly - YIKES! Translating that rate into sterling is frightening.  GIS professionals must be ten a penny in the US is all I can say if that it the limit of your earning expectations.\n\nThird (and a more serious commentary expanding on Conor&#39;s answer) - The answer to your question depends a lot on the sector in which you are applying your GIS skills.  This is first and foremost the deciding factor.  If I was working in the oil industry I would be charging double what I am at the moment (but GIS for the oil industry is a little bit specialized and some of the skills very niche e.g. bespoke geological software skills required rather than just ArcGIS or what have you).  \n\nI set my rate initially by taking my (then) annual salary (gross of tax to allow for some corporate tax and sundries as very roughly equivalent to my income tax and UK National Insurnce) and divided by 200 to give me a day rate.  I used 200 because I used to work in a commercial GIS group where there was a concept of &#39;200 chargeable days&#39; - the remaining 165 days being taken up by weekends, sick leave, holidays, personal development, business development (including website maintenance), computer maintenance etc.  This was a formula which worked well in my experience.  For an hourly rate I divided the day rate by 7 because:\n\n\nI am a highly qualified and experienced professional and well worth it\nDuring a normal working day you take time out for lunch, making coffee, going to the toilet, answering the phone and so on - as a freelancer you must allow for this.\n\n\nUsing this simple calculation you can work out what you personally must charge to maintain your current standard of living.  Anything less would represent an unacceptable drop in salary and mean it is not worth going freelance.\n\nThe aim of going freelance is to get flexibility, self determination, personal satisfaction and because you have noticed how your current employer is benefiting from your skills and you would like a cut of that money.  The above calculation is just a baseline and to improve on it, you can put your prices up and you work harder once you get a feel for the market.  However, this method of calculating your hourly rate will reflect the market you personally work in and the level at which you are working (as Conor says, it depends on whether you are a junior technician or doing advanced spatial analysis for instance).\n\nADDITIONAL COMMENT:\nI should add that, after all the talk about a minimum acceptable rate, it isn&#39;t just about the money.  As a freelancer I personally have gained a lot more job satisfaction and can meet my clients&#39; needs without all the bureaucracy of a large organisation getting in the way.  I am also a lot more hands-on, which I enjoy and which I was losing with increasing seniority in a traditional employed role.  This sense of satisfaction and achievement are worth a lot and can&#39;t be expressed in a simple monetary rate.  This is the hidden bonus (though I grant you, you can&#39;t eat it and it doesn&#39;t pay the mortgage).\n",

It\n  should be treated as a special case and should not be viewed as the\n  type of question that is encouraged on this, or any Stack Exchange\n  site, but if you wish to contribute more content to it then feel free\n  to do so by editing this answer.\n\n\n\n\nOf course it is ultimately up to you, but i would hesitate to call working with OpenStreetMap a waste of time.\n\nWhile it is true that the OSM user base is small right now, there are factors that affect both Google and OSM. The primary issue is that now that Google has started to charge for levels of use of their API, a number of companies and organizations are switching to OSM. The list includes Apple, Foursquare, and Wikipedia mobile apps. It looks like more may switch as well, which could increase the user base significantly.\nThis is one aspect.\n\nThe other, and that which seems more important to me is the idea of open access to data. As a Geographer and GIS professional, having access to high quality datasets is critical for me to do my job. Having access that can not be compromised is even more important. The OSM dataset is licensed as Open Data Commons Open Database License, so anyone may use it. Google data is privately owned and while this likely won&#39;t happen, they could close it off tomorrow and charge everyone for access, whether you helped improve the dataset or not.\n\nI know that here in the United States access to data is a big issue.  A lot of time and money is spent collecting and building the datasets, and a big question is who should pick up this cost.  There are arguments either way.  I am sure this is an issue in other parts of the world as well, especially in places where there are not as many sources of data like streets available for people to use.\n\nThis is a pretty hot topic you picked here, with strong, valid feelings on both sides.  Google has every right to charge for their data, and make a profit.  People have the same right to build their own dataset and make it available to everyone. There is nothing to say you can&#39;t support both, just don&#39;t sell one short over the other without researching on your own, and drawing your own conclusions.\n",

            "body": "I am doing an astronomy project. I want to have the information about our images stored in a spatially enabled database. This, I would think, should be a very easy special case for GIS functions because the sky can be treated as perfectly spherical, and does not require an elliptical treatment like the surface of the earth. Unfortunately, I have not found a way to do this yet and I have been dodging mines with spatial functions that use an elliptical earth. (Pretty much any function that returns meters instead of degrees may be using an elliptical calculation. Luckily, many of the PostGIS functions I&#39;ve needed appear to have incomplete implementations where the documentation explicitly states that the returned results are for a sphere and not for the ellipsoid. But that may change with future versions, which is a cause for concern.)\nBackground: I am presently using PostgreSQL with PostGIS and WGS 84 coordinates (SRID=4326). This works fairly well. I am creating a closed POLYGON from the right ascension and declination of the four corners of the image. I have a lot of images (10k or more), covering a large area of the sky. Each images is about 1 degree square. From the set of these images, I am making mosaics from small subsets of 15 to 30 images. Each mosaic is about 1.5 degree square.\nPresently, I am storing the geography of the mosaics as a MULTIPOLYGON that consists of all the POLYGONS corresponding to each image that went into the mosaic. [A better solution would be to create a single POLYGON that describes the perimeter of the union of all the individual polygons. I don&#39;t know if this can be done in spherical coordinates (i.e., that the geography type). This would also be an interesting answer for me too.] The date line and celestial poles may be included in an image in the dataset so I have been avoiding projecting to planar coordinates to the extent possible.\nWhat coordinate system ought I use for celestial coordinates with PostGIS functions?\nI have looked at  http://spatialreference.org/ but have not found anything so far. Google has turned up little. I am stumped. Basically, I want to ensure that if a function returns meters as a distance, it is meters along a great circle on a sphere.\n\nI am using PostGIS 1.5.2. I have not yet tried PostGIS 2.0. I am curious if the ST_CoveredBy function works with a POLYGON and a MULTIPOLYGON of type geography. If anybody is running 2.0, could you tell me if you get the same error as this:\n\n\nI have tried PostGIS 2.0. This function still only works on points and polygons, not more general shapes.\n",

One of them works a little like your description, but instead of slicing the polygons at &quot;random&quot; locations you can do it purposefully in a way designed to minimize the amount of computation.\n\nHere is the basic algorithm.  Its input consists of any plane sweep direction, a polygon P of nonzero area, a target area a between zero and the polygon&#39;s area, and a nonnegative threshold t (in units of area).  Its purpose is to split P with a line perpendicular to the sweep direction into two parts, one to the right of the line and the other to the left of the line, such that the difference between the righthand area and the target area a is no greater than t.\n\nLet L be any oriented line perpendicular to the sweep direction.  Define f(L) to be the area of P found at the right of L, minus a.  In these terms the task is to find a zero of f.  Because f is unlikely to be differentiable, but is continuous, use either a bisection method, the secant method, or--my favorite--Brent&#39;s method.  All are simple and guaranteed to converge.  Use t for the convergence tolerance for the argument.\n\nThat&#39;s it.  Let&#39;s consider what goes into coding this.  The root finding is routine--you can use a generic chunk of code for it--so the GIS work comes down to coding f.  Doing so requires\n\n\n\nBoth operations are implemented in almost any vector-based GIS.  If not, you can replace the line by a very large rectangle representing the half-plane to the right of the line.  Step 1 becomes\n\n\n\nThat is a really basic operation.\n\nTo get started with root finding, you need to find an interval in which the zero of f is guaranteed to lie.  This is easy: project the polygon&#39;s envelope (&quot;bounding box&quot;) into the direction of the line sweep.  The projection is the interval you want.\n\nThis question has a long history.  I implemented this algorithm for ArcView 3.x long ago and described it many times in the old ESRI user forums.  Google\n\n\n  huber split polygon site:forums.esri.com\n\n\nfor discussions, links to code, enhancements and variations (such as splitting polygons into parts of desired sizes which are as compact as possible) and algorithms for raster data.\n\nHere is what the continental US states look like (in an equal area projection) with the bottom third of each state shaded.  Evidently the sweep direction was vertical.\n\n\n",

            "body": "JOSM\n\nPerhaps the easiest answer to both parts of your question, is to use JOSM. The Java OpenStreetMap Editor. It&#39;s easy to download data, and easy to &quot;use&quot; data.\n\nFor downloading, JOSM provides a simple interface to let you select a rectangular area to download, however it downloads this via the editing API. This will reject any request which is way too big, and if it&#39;s a little bit too big it will spend a long time thinking about it. Generally a whole city is way too big, but you might be able to get a good a chunk of data by requesting several rectangular areas.\n\nFor &quot;using&quot; the data JOSM lets you see the data and have a good poke around in all the tags. The search feature is quite powerful, allowing you to select elements with particular tags, but beyond that it really depends what kind of &quot;use&quot; you have in mind. You can configure the way JOSM displays the data to some extent, but for nice looking maps you&#39;d probably want to look at rendering tools designed to work with OSM files. You can also look at conversion e.g. to shapefile, but bare in mind the data is ...different ...to what you might be used to, so this conversion is always a bit lossy.\n\nAs an aside...  Although it&#39;s reasonably nice data viewer, the primary purpose of JOSM is to be an OpenStreetMap editor. Just click &#39;upload&#39; to send changes back to OpenStreetMap  (you&#39;ll need to create an OpenStreetMap account) If you didn&#39;t try OpenStreetMap editing yet, you really should. Anyone with even a passing interest in maps should give this a go. Add your local restaurant to the map or something like that. It&#39;s the only way to get a proper understanding of OpenStreetMap, and it&#39;s fun!\n\nBigger files\n\nWhat if a city is too big to load into JOSM? There&#39;s some other options (as follows) but when you&#39;re dealing with this amount of data there&#39;s no escaping the fact that it&#39;s going to be a little bit difficult to &quot;use&quot;. You&#39;re really out of the realm of fun little GUI tools and into big data GIS. The easiest entry to this (which is not all that easy) would probably be to load a large .osm file into PostGIS database using osm2pgsql, and then use GIS desktop tools to view it.\n\nCity extracts\n\nThis download.bbbike.org service offers ready-made downloads for some world cities.\n\nOsmosis\n\nIf you need a different city or different bounding box, then you need to get one of the massive downloads you mentioned (either a country extract, or the whole planet) and then extract a piece out of it.\n\nosmosis is the most widely used tool for this. It&#39;s a java command line tool letting you extract a bounding box on the unix command line with something like this:\n\n\n\nThis shows how you would typically avoid filling your disk with bloated XML data by uncompressing a .bz2 file, piping the output into osmosis and then piping the resulting XML into a bzipped file again.\n\nSo maybe this is not fitting with your definition of &quot;easy&quot;, but osmosis is a worthwhile tool to get the hang of if you&#39;re interested in manipulating big .osm files. You just have to figure out the right command! (good topic for another question I guess)\n",

I always have access to them, and they are very organized, dis and aggregated. You&#39;ll spend a lot of time organizing these.\nI put them all in databases whether in Arc or PostGIS.\nTo each table, I add 3 fields in the table itself or the meta data: DATE_OBTAINED, DATA_DATE, SOURCE_NOTES\nAlso Base files could be queries of multiple other tables. For example, a table could aggregate all the traffic count I obtain into one large query/table.\nI also put here all other data that I find scouring the internet.\nI NEVER DO ANY DIRECT ANALYSIS ON ANY OF THE FILES IN THE BASE FILES\n\n\nProject Files\n\n\nAll my project files go in a  folder. It contains everything related to that project as in, if I copy and paste that folder somewhere else, it will contain everything.\nUsually I have the following structure: \n\nmy_project/\n\nadmin/\ncommunication/\nraw_data/\nanalyzed_data/\noutput_data/\nfrom_client/\nFINAL/\ncode/\nsome_document_date_time.doc\nREADME\n\n\nSlowly I&#39;ve been moving to a local GIT. (you can even host it locally or on your own server). The reason I do not put it on GitHub is that github has a 1.2gb limit which is useless for GIS analysis\nFor my projects, I usually replicate all the GIS tables that I need for my analysis into a new db: project_whatever.\n9 times out of 10, I work only in shp files and I save all my GIS (images, excel, coordinates, etc) to my , , and . \nWhen a project is complete, I put the final submitted copy in \nFor my MXD, I usually save to a new MXD every 2 or 3 hours  for example\nFor Ms Word documents, illustrations, and mostly editing documents, they go in my_projects folder  such as  and . Again all my final deliverables go in in the FINAL folder\nFor R, Python code and some C#, it gets a bit tricky, as I host it outside of the project but with a working copy to  folder. I do this as most of the python code is reusable. If you put all your python code besides the projects, you&#39;ll forget about them. Also, all my python code goes on github.\nTo me project files include any file types including time tracking, communications (I save all my emails as .msg files), I log all our verbal communications in a word file, and I put all those files my_project/communication\nWith ArcGIS use Models, LYR, and &quot;save selection as a new shp layer&quot;. These tools will make it easy to store files in smaller formats, reuse files, and with models, be able to use something in another place.\n\n\nFinal Output\n\n\nEach project when finalized gets zipped and put on my external harddrive.\nAll final products are converted to files from Tables, and to PDF from all other formats. \nEvery Project I do, gets printed for a hard copy backup\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\n\nEach person uses multiple and different software and tools. A lot of people I know get organized using basecamp, Harvest, or any other multitude of tools. Also people have different working habits and OCD tendencies. I&#39;m fairly obsessed with getting stuff organized maybe a bit more than others. So develop the system that causes you the least stress while guaranteeing you&#39;ll be consistent in applying and updating it\nBackup and replicate everything\nDon&#39;t work directly on your raw / base data\nFor your projects always use a replica file, as data changes over time, and you don&#39;t want to be scrambling to find the .\neach my_projects folder must have a README text file that you edit it while you&#39;re doing the projects to give some basic information that you know you&#39;ll forget later when you visit the project 2 years down the road\n\n",

Telling them that GIS stands for Geographic Information Systems, which encompasses a set of technologies that can be used to analyze, map, and organize spatial data is a bit over most people heads.
