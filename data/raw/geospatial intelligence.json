This erroneous geospatial positioning information poses an unacceptable risk to global safety of navigation activities, and department of defense, intelligence community, and allied partner systems, missions, and operations that require accurate and precise positioning and navigation information. The NGA Geomatics Office reminds the community to use DoD approved World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) applications for all mission critical activities.&quot;\n\nEPSG:3395 is WGS 84 compliant.  EPSG:3857 is NOT!  You are seeing the reason why. \n\nI didn&#39;t realize that either until I was most of the way thru a project and I was finally told that I couldn&#39;t use EPSG:3857 for the above reasons.  I scrambled to find a replacement and came up with EPSG:3395.  It was a relatively painless conversion as all I had to do was change the projection declaration in the code.  However, a major issue then came up when I ran into the problem of conversions between EPSG:3395 and the other projection I was using, EPSG:4326 which is in LAT/LON rather than meters.  Openlayers only supports conversions between EPSG:4326 and EPSG:3857 out of the box.  If you want to use any other projection, such as EPSG:3395, you need to use proj4.js and OpenLayers knows to automatically look into proj4.js for the routines it needs.  However, you need to prime the pump, so to speak.  You need to declare the projection definition string, an example for EPSG:3395 follows.\n\n\n\nThis one can be found at https://epsg.io/3395.  I&#39;ve run into another problem with this though that I am trying solve.  The projections don&#39;t work the same. I have documented the problem here and I am looking for any information anyone has as to why.\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/51528830/epsg3395-projection-not-providing-map-wrapping\n",

An Interoperability Standard provides detailed direction on how to use the clauses, options, and parameters of the base standard(s).\n\nThe GeoPackage spec stores tiles in a tile pyramid which has nothing to do with XYZ tiles (although you can configure a GeoPackage to mirror XYZ tiles).\n\nThe gpkg_tile_matrix_set table defines the spatial reference system (srs_id) and the maximum bounding box (min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y) for all possible tiles in a tile pyramid user data table.\nThe tile coordinate (0,0) always refers to the tile in the upper left corner of the tile matrix at any zoom level, regardless of the actual availability of that tile.\n\nThe NSG GeoPackage spec restricts the tile dimensions to 256x256, zoom levels by a factor of 2, and bounding boxes to represent the full global tile indexing scheme.\n\nNSG Req 20: The gpkg_tile_matrix table SHALL contain tile_width and tile_height column values of 256 for every table_name tile pyramid data table.\nNSG Req 21: Every tile_data tile in every table_name tile pyramid data table shall have a width and height of 256 pixels.\nNSG Req 22: The gpkg_tile_matrix table SHALL contain pixel_x_size and pixel_y_size column values that differ by a factor of 2 between all adjacent zoom levels for each tile pyramid data table per OGC GeoPackage Clause 2.2.3.

Each instance is called a zone and is given a \nzone number Z between -60 and +60 excluding zero. \n\nSource:NATIONAL GEOSPATIAL-INTELLIGENCE AGENCY STANDARDIZATION DOCUMENT Implementation Practice The Universal Grids and the Transverse Mercator and Polar Stereographic Map Projections 2014-03-25, NGA.SIG.0012_2.0.0_UTMUPS, Section 7.1 page 32.   \n\nSecond, the International Standards Organization (ISO) group has published the standard for Spatial Reference Models, and it defines UTM as: \n\nA set of 120 localized Spatial Reference Frames (SRFs), \nwhere limited overlap is modelled by extended validity regions in the member SRFs. \n\nSource: International Standard ISO / IEC 18026, Information Technology: Spatial Reference Model, ISO / IEC 18026, Section 8.7.7 - Table 8.6.0, page 192.\n\nSo, one could also make a case for 120 cylinders (half cylinders?) since each UTM zone could be aligned to a unique one.  If the mappers use different ellipsoids for their UTM projections, then the cylinders will naturally be different too.\n\nI think the UTM standard for the US to only use the WGS 1984 ellipsoid - and that is the standard.  The referenced NGA document also spelled out approaches for TM to be applied to many other ellipsoids, starting at page 20. \n\nI hope this helps - corrections welcome.\n",

That will be some variant of ITRFxx or the local geographic CRS like NAD83 (2011) (USA) or NAD83 (CSRS) (Canada) or GDA2020 (upcoming in Australia). \n\nThe local systems have been derived using the ITRF network, plus the country&#39;s control network and usually fixed. This enables surveyors, GIS, etc. to not worry about the coordinates jiggling continuously. USA, in particular, keeps their control network fixed to the North American, Pacific, or Mariana plates to minimize the change in coordinates over time. When there&#39;s been enough movement (plate motion, subsidence, glacial rebound, earthquakes), the geodetic agency may do a re-adjustment or calculate a new realization and update the coordinates of the control network.\n\nSeveral countries are planning to go to dynamic or semi-dynamic CRS which will more closely match what IERS does with the ITRF realizations.
