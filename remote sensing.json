            "body": "Let&#39;s start from the beginning. \n\nHow satellite remote sensing work\n\nSatellites carry out sensors that can measure radiance at different wavelengths (it depends on the sensor)\n\n\n\nFor example,\n\n\n  Landsat 8 carries a two-sensor payload: the Operational Land Imager\n  (OLI), built by the Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies Corporation; and the\n  Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), built by the NASA Goddard Space Flight\n  Center (GSFC)\n  (https://landsat.usgs.gov/landsat-8-l8-data-users-handbook-section-2)\n\n\nOLI sensor measures radiance at 9 different wavelengths and TIRS at 2 different wavelengths:\n\n\n\nThe first measurement of the sensor (raw data) is taken in Digital Numbers and converted to radiance based on the rescaling factors provided in the metadata file. \n\nDepending on the sensor, the resulting data type can differ. Landsat 1 to 7 raw data is a 8-bits data (each band), so values can go from 0 to 255 (256 options). Landsat 8 raw is a 16-bit data, so values can go from 0 to 65535 (65536 options).\n\nIf you look the description for  (raw) in Google Earth Engine you&#39;ll see\n\n\n  Landsat 8 Collection 1 Tier 1 DN values, representing scaled,\n  calibrated at-sensor radiance.\n  (https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/LANDSAT_LC08_C01_T1)\n\n\nAnd you can check the data types in the code editor: \n\n\n\nRadiometric corrections\n\n\n  The energy that sensors onboard aircrafts or satellites record can\n  differ from the actual energy emitted or reflected from a surface on\n  the ground. This is due to the sun&#39;s azimuth and elevation and\n  atmospheric conditions that can influence the observed energy.\n  Therefore, in order to obtain the real ground irradiance or\n  reflectance, radiometric errors must be corrected for.\n  (http://gsp.humboldt.edu/olm_2015/courses/gsp_216_online/lesson4-1/radiometric.html)\n\n\n\n\nAfter the data has been corrected, the output depends on the process made and may be in a different data type, such as , , etc. (I couldn&#39;t find a good reference source for this).\n\nYou can check it in Google Earth Engine\n\n\n\nAs you can see in the results, Landsat 8 TOA has a  data type, which means that the data goes from 0 to 1, and SR has a  data type, which means that data goes from -32768 to 32767. Though, the latter has a particularity, real values go from 0 to 10000 (there isn&#39;t values lower than 0 neither greater than 10000).\n\nFinally,\n\nHow a monitor works\n\n\n  To create a single colored pixel, an LCD display uses three subpixels\n  with red, green and blue filters. Through the careful control and\n  variation of the voltage applied, the intensity of each subpixel can\n  range over 256 shades. Combining the subpixels produces a possible\n  palette of 16.8 million colors (256 shades of red x 256 shades of\n  green x 256 shades of blue).\n  (https://computer.howstuffworks.com/monitor4.htm)\n\n\nSo, if a pixel has a values Red: 0, Blue: 0, Green: 0, the pixel color will be black, and if values are Red: 255, Blue: 255, Green: 255, the pixel color will be white.\n\nThere are plenty of sites to play around with this, like this one: https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp\n\nPutting all together\n\nYour monitor can show only three colors: Red, Green and Blue (RGB). So, to visualize a raster you first have to choose which bands will represent those colors. That is the parameter  of . Then, you have to tell the monitor which value (out of the range) will represent the 0 (min) and which the 255 (max). This are the parameters  and  of . You can also specify different  and  for each band using a list of three values instead of just one value.\n\nLet&#39;s say you want to visualize a Landsat 8 TOA image as you were sitting on top of the satellite (real color). So, you have to tell the monitor to use the Red band (band 4) of the raster for the Red subpixel of the monitor, the Green band (band 3) for the Green subpixel and the Blue band (band 2) for the Blue subpixel. Then, you have to tell the monitor how to stretch the values from the raster, that as we&#39;ve seen for Landsat 8 TOA can go from 0 to 1 (because it&#39;s a ), to the values of the subpixels (that go from 0 to 255). So,\n\n\n\nBut you&#39;ll find out that the image looks &quot;too dark&quot; for that stretching (it depends on the reflectance of the objects you are seeing), so make the  smaller to see it &quot;brighter&quot;, for example, \n\nI leave you a simple app I made to show this:\nhttps://fitoprincipe.users.earthengine.app/view/stretch\n\nsource: https://code.earthengine.google.com/cdf508ac8ae98a35364758d4c585bba2\n\nIf you want to see the same Landsat scene from other collections you have to know how the data is presented in each collection.\n\nFinally, there are some methods to stretch the values automatically using the raster histogram, such as Standard Deviations, Minimum-Maximum, Percent Clip, Sigmoid, etc. (http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/raster-and-images/stretch-function.htm).\nEarth Engine let&#39;s you use some\n\n\n",

            "body": "IDL is a fantastic stand-alone programming language (you do not need ENVI). I particularity like it for very fast matrix processing on large arrays. @Aaron makes IDL sound much less flexible then it really is. The majority of IDL development came out of the Physics and Astronomy communities. There is robust support for mathematical and statistical programming. If bundled with ENVI, you have all the library calls (functions) available in ENVI including support for spatial vector objects. There are also a large number of functions and models developed by the user community. One advantage to learning IDL is that it will make you marketable in &quot;analytic&quot; remote sensing shops. \n\nAlso, do not forget that ERDAS has a scripting language (EML) that is quite good and easy to learn. EML is the backbone of the graphic modeler and gmd&#39;s are just packaged EML scripts that sit under the graphic modeler interface. The advantage of using EML directly is that you can use for/while loops and have access to more ERDAS functionality in a scripting language.         \n\nMATLAB is also very good for matrix processing and there are open source versions (e.g., Octave) that have exactly the same syntax with similar benchmarks. This is a highly flexible language with considerable power. It is one of the preferred language for applied mathematics and engineering.      \n\nThe Python alternatives NumPy and SciPy are flexible but not as optimized as IDL and MATLAB. As such, you need to deal with addressing space and speed when working with large arrays. One huge advantage of Python are the additional libraries for performing a variety of analytical tasks. There are packages for remote sensing,  nonparametric statistics, bindings to spatial classes (e.g. GDAL, LibLAS) to name just some of the added functionality available through packages. \n\nThis brings us to R. I am primarily a spatial statistician so, this is my everyday language. The number of available packages is staggering which, in turn, provides access to cutting edge cross-discipline statistical methodologies. However, I have to say that it is very cumbersome when dealing with large data problems. The spatial classes are getting much better and because of the raster package providing the ability to hold large data out of memory I am now able to implement some fairly complex statistical models utilizing large raster arrays. But still, R is slow when dealing with large memory problems. The BigMatrix package allows for writing and processing huge arrays from disk but the coding overhead is not insignificant There are also bindings to GDAL and GIS software (e.g., GRASS, SAGA) that allow spatial object processing to occur outside of R in a GIS specific software, which is how I interact with GIS software these days. This allows me to leverage functionality across multiple software without leaving R.                \n\nSo, now that the software cheerleading is out of the way, my recommendation is &quot;yes to all of the above options&quot;. Programming is a skill that, once learned, is easily applied to other languages. There are striking similarities between C++, R, IDL and Python. Aside from some coding idiocentricities, what one must learn are the available functions to implement a given model/task. Once this is done it is just a matter of syntax that implements common coding structures. \n\nSometimes there are things that just work better in a different software or language. I occasionally write code in FORTRAN or C++ because it is just the best choice for a given task. It is a matter of adaptability. You may want to start with Python because, as a  scripting language, it can be applied to numerous tasks it also provides availability of packages for specialized analysis, has a number of free online resources and is somewhat easy to learn.           \n",

One emitted laser pulse can return to the lidar sensor as one or\n  many returns. Any emitted laser pulse that encounters multiple\n  reflection surfaces as it travels toward the ground is split into as\n  many returns as there are reflective surfaces.\n  \n  The first returned laser pulse is the most significant return and will\n  be associated with the highest feature in the landscape like a treetop\n  or the top of a building. The first return can also represent the\n  ground, in which case only one return will be detected by the lidar\n  system.\n  \n  Multiple returns are capable of detecting the elevations of several\n  objects within the laser footprint of an outgoing laser pulse. The\n  intermediate returns, in general, are used for vegetation structure,\n  and the last return for bare-earth terrain models.\n  \n  The last return will not always be from a ground return.

            "body": "There is a good information about these terms on Basudeb Bhatta&#39;s Blog at this link, copied below. \n\n@Brad Nesom&#39;s definitions are good but I thought that geodata was an abbreviation of &quot;geographic data.&quot; However, Brad&#39;s definition of geodata is quite logical.\n\nBeside these in my opinion:\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n  Often my students ask about the difference(s) between spatial and\n  geospatial. These two words appear very frequently in remote sensing\n  and GIS literature.\n  \n  The word spatial originated from Latin &#39;spatium&#39;, which means space.\n  Spatial means &#39;pertaining to space&#39; or &#39;having to do with space,\n  relating to space and the position, size, shape, etc.&#39; (Oxford\n  Dictionary), which refers to features or phenomena distributed in\n  three-dimensional space (any space, not only the Earth&#39;s surface) and,\n  thus, having physical, measurable dimensions. In GIS, &#39;spatial&#39; is\n  also referred to as &#39;based on location on map&#39;.\n  \n  Geographic(al) means &#39;pertaining to geography (the study of the\n  surface of the earth)&#39; and &#39;referring to or characteristic of a\n  certain locality, especially in reference to its location in relation\n  to other places&#39; (Macquarie Dictionary). Spatial has broader meaning,\n  encompassing the term geographic. Geographic data can be defined as a\n  class of spatial data in which the frame is the surface and/or\n  near-surface of the Earth. &#39;Geographic&#39; is the right word for graphic\n  presentation (e.g., maps) of features and phenomena on or near the\n  Earth&#39;s surface. Geographic data uses different feature types (raster,\n  points, lines, or polygons) to uniquely identify the location and/or\n  the geographical boundaries of spatial (location based) entities that\n  exist on the earth surface. Geographic data are a significant subset\n  of spatial data, although the terms geographic, spatial, and\n  geospatial are often used interchangeably.\n  \n  Geospatial is another word, and might have originated in the industry\n  to make the things differentiate from geography. Though this word is\n  becoming popular, it has not been defined in any of the standard\n  dictionary yet. Since &#39;geo&#39; is from Greek &#39;gaya&#39; meaning Earth,\n  geospatial thus means earth-space. NASA says &#39;geospatial means the\n  distribution of something in a geographic sense; it refers to entities\n  that can be located by some co-ordinate system&#39;. Geospatial data is to\n  develop information about features, objects, and classes on Earth&#39;s\n  surface and/or near Earth&#39;s surface. Geospatial is that type of\n  spatial data which is related to the Earth, but the terms spatial and\n  geospatial are often used interchangeably. United States Geological\n  Survey (USGS) says &quot;the terms spatial and geospatial are equivalent&quot;.\n\n",

The winner is... well, actually you have no winner but 90m SRTM for me is nosing ahead. \n\n\n\nThe green line is SRTM and the red is ASTER.\n\nI can say I evaluated 30m SRTM (global 30 m SRTM is now available) and 30 m ASTER for Borneo and 30 m SRTM won my race, by a furlong. You see though, I wanted watersheds and had a hydrological algorithm in GRASS specifically built for the errors in SRTM so it was not a fair race. What you want to do with it matters greatly, as does where. GTOPO30 may work great at the continental scale, whereas I need LIDAR at 1 m resolution to calculate drainage on my agricultural fields. EU DEM is at approx. 25 m and may meet your needs and all the modeling information can be found online. Actually, this is the same for GTOPO, SRTM, and ASTER as well as in the LIDAR link given. All the construction information for the major free DEMS, and many of the minor ones, exists online.\n\nYou need to decide what DEM bests fits your application and needs. We cannot do that and you have not told us your needs or even the region you are working in.

There are currently no methods\n  to check spectral stability with time from either on-orbit or Ground\n  measurements.\n\n\n(Source: Dr. John Barke)\n\nIn addition to RSR,  is so important for repetitive data acquisition cycle...\n\nThis is the relative spectral response for LANDSAT TM:\n\n\n\nThere is an information here about Assessment of NDVI- differences caused by sensor-\nspecific relative spectral response functions.\n\nAbstract is here:\n\n\n  The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)  is the most often\n  used remote sensing-based indicator to monitor  dynamics of land\n  surfaces and environmental changes. Due to  different sensor\n  characteristics, the NDVI values vary according  to the recording\n  system. This study focuses on the factor of  spectral sensor\n  characteristics, which can complicate the  interpretation of\n  multisensoral NDVI data. Therefore,  multispectral bands of Landsat\n  5TM, QuickBird and SPOT5  were simulated from hyperspectral data.\n  These simulated data  sets show identical characteristics (except\n  spectrally) like sensor  geometry, atmospheric conditions, topography\n  and spatial  resolution. This allows a direct comparison of NDVI\n  differences  caused by the factor of different spectral\n  characteristics.\n\n\nI have made a summary for you from this document about spectral values for NIR and Red band...\n\n\n\nRelative spectral response functions of the red and near-infrared \nbands of Landsat 5TM, QuickBird and SPOT5 with 2 typical land cover \nspectra. \n\nThe Result :\n\n\n  Especially in the NIR  region the RSR functions of the sensors vary\n  from each other.

Each pixel is an n-dimensional vector and will be assigned to some class according to some metric, whether using Support Vector Machines, MLE, some kind of knn classifier, etc.\n\nAs far as region based classifiers are concerned, though, there have been huge developments in the last few years, driven by a combination of GPUs, vast amounts of data, the cloud and wide availability of algorithms thanks to the growth of open source (facilitated by github). One of the biggest developments in computer vision/classification has been in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The convolutional layers &quot;learn&quot; features which might be based on colour, as with traditional pixel-based classifiers, but also create edge detectors and all kinds of other feature extractors that could exist in an region of pixels (hence the convolutional part) that you could never extract from a pixel-based classification. This means they are less likely to mis-classify a pixel in the middle of an area of pixels of some other type -- if you have ever run a classification and got ice in the middle of the Amazon, you will understand this problem.\n\nYou then apply a fully connected neural net to the &quot;features&quot; learnt via the convolutions to actually do the classification. One of the other great advantages of CNNs is that they are scale and rotation invariant, as there are usually intermediate layers between the convolution layers and the classification layer that generalize features, using pooling and dropout, to avoid overfitting, and help with the issues around scale and orientation.\n\nThere are numerous resources on convolutional neural networks, although the best has to be the Standord class from Andrei Karpathy, who is one of the pioneers of this field, and the entire lecture series is available on youtube.\n\nSure, there are other ways of dealing with pixel versus area based classification, but this is currently the state of the art approach, and has many applications beyond remote sensing classification, such as machine translation and self-driving cars.\n\nHere is another example of region-based classification, using Open Street Map for tagged training data, including instructions for setting up TensorFlow and running on AWS.\n\nHere is an example using Google Earth Engine of a classifier based on edge detection, in this case for pivot irrigation -- using nothing more than a Gaussian kernel and convolutions, but again, showing the power of region/edge based approaches.\n\n\n\nWhile the superiority of object over pixel-based classfication is fairly widely accepted, here is an interesting article in Remote Sensing Letters assessing the performance of object-based classification.\n\nFinally, an amusing example, just to show that even with regional/convolutional based classifiers, computer vision is still really hard -- fortunately, the smartest people at Google, Facebook, etc, are working on algorithms to be able to determine the difference between dogs, cats, and different breeds of dogs and cats.

These points are presumed to be regular in some fashion, for example, the next row of values in the data structure corresponds the next row of the grid, geographically speaking, in some direction, such as the next row to the south. However, if you look at basic satellite remote sensing imagery, the &quot;raw&quot; (that is, sensor-calibrated, but not gridded) raster data usually called Level 1 corresponds to rows of imagery data as seen by the sensor. For example, a sensor might image 10 rows at an east-west swipe, with the next swipe taking in the next 10 rows, and each data pixel has a lat/long pair (on the ground) associated with it. But as the field of view of a satellite-borne sensor widens at the swath edges, the first row of the next swipe might well, at least partially, overlap and intertwine with the last row of the previous swipe. This makes gridding raster data from a satellite-borne sensor non-trivial in practice.\nConversely, &quot;raster&quot; primarily refers to a characteristic of a data structure, that is, a 2D array. If the gridded data is on a non-rectangular grid (such as triangular, hexagonal), it may be stored in a non-raster data structure such as a tree of some sort.\n\n\nIn your case, the main question is not whether you are dealing with &quot;gridded&quot; or &quot;raster&quot; data. Chances are, the data is either gridded or available on a raster with lat/long attributes in each cell and without overlaps and weird artefacts: processed data is usually corrected for this. The main question for you is whether your tools are compatible with the data format you have. \n",

            "body": "It is sometimes difficult to distinguish calibration and correction in remote sensing, because we are not in a laboratory with full control on the measurement. Therefore the two are often mixed.\n\nSensu stricto, radiometric calibration is the conversion from the sensor measurement to a physical quantity. In remote sensing, the sensor is measuring a radiance from the top of the atmosphere. Therefore the image provider also provide calibration coefficients to convert from digit number (DN) to radiance. Because we can trust the amount of light energy that comes from the sun, the radiance is often normalized into a reflectance values (easier to work with because bounded by 0 and one), so this step can also be part of the calibration. So the calibration gives you a reflectance value, but it is the reflectance on top of the atmosphere (TOA).\n\nIndeed, the proportion of the incident light that is really reflected by the observed object is effected by different factors (mainly topography and atmospheric thickness). The reflectances measured TOA therefore need to be corrected if you need absolute values. This does not depend on the sensor itself, so I would not talk about calibration in this case: you need to correct the values measured TOA in order to estimate the values top of canopy. \n\nTo answer your question, I would thus say that DOS is a correction method and DN to TOA reflectance is a calibration. DOS require a stable dark object where you can assume that variability is due to atmospheric noise, which is difficult to find. \n\nEDIT: for more info on Landsat atmospheric correction, I recommend LEDAPS (Masek et al, 2013)\nFor Sentinel-2, different algorithms have been proposed and I cannot give a definitive answer yet. SEN2COR is used a lot, and MAJA is great if you work with time series (also for Landsat, by the way). \n",

I&#39;ll provide you with some ideas based off of specific skills that I often see requested at the GIS jobs clearinghouse.  You can pretty much go two separate routes here (or both simultaneously) and both are pretty wide open:\n\n\n\nBuilding your analysis skills\n\n\n\n\nLearn about rasters. Zonal statistics, DEM/DSM&#39;s, viewshed analysis, local statistics, hydrologic modeling are all branches of Geostatistics, knowledge of which is important for analysis. The Geospatial Data Abstraction Library is a great repository for useful tools and information.\nLearn about remote sensing. I see plenty of job postings asking for expertise in analyzing and managing LiDAR datasets.\nBecome familiar with geocoding, pretty much any entity that keeps address data is usually interested in utilizing geocoding.\n\n\n\n\nBuilding your GIS Developer skills\n\n\n\n\nPython, Python, Python. You&#39;ll hear it over and over again here. This is the GIS scripting language. I used the free courseware from Udacity to learn Python, which I think they do a pretty good job of, but I suggest instead Learn Python the Hard Way.\nIf you want to stick to the ESRI suite, learn C#. At the very least, Microsoft is sticking with this as its go-to language for a very long time. It&#39;s future is more certain than the .NET alternative, VB.NET.\nLearn SQL. For the most part, basic SQL is standardized across all major RDBMS platforms, with all the extra bells and whistles integrated into the special SQL languages such as T-SQL and PL/SQL. Don&#39;t bother with all that yet, if you get the basic standardized language down, you&#39;ll cover 80% of the things you need to do with it and the other 20% you can pick up as you need. W3C has some great simple and straightforward samples to get you started here.\nLearn database architecture. Understand the concepts of normalization and relationships, what primary and foreign keys are, and how to build a database. There are a lot of jobs that involve structuring your GIS data. In the same vein, understanding the underlying structure of geodatabases is key if you want to become a developer in the ESRI suite of products.\nLearn web development. More importantly, learn Javascript. This is a rapidly growing field. I see tons of job postings from businesses that want web GIS applications. There are a few different API&#39;s you can familiarize yourself with. If you want to go open source, two popular ones are OpenLayers and leaflet.js. If you want to stick with ESRI, I wouldn&#39;t go with Flash or Silverlight API&#39;s, I would use Javascript and HTML only. \n\n",

            "body": "Short answer\nI think you should reevaluate your very concept of &quot;official&quot;, high detailed source for all country borders worldwide. OpenStreetMap data comes close to a worldwide dataset with acceptable level of details for many use cases - however, in each case, this must be evaluated critically.\n&quot;Official&quot; sources for borders\nFor a really &quot;official&quot; source, you would have to check 200 +/- official sources of all +/- 200 existing countries wordlwide. Borders are defined on a bilateral base. The actual delimitation takes place between two neighboring countries. For that reason, there cannot be an &quot;official&quot; registry of all worldwide borders, but at best +/- 200 &quot;national&quot; datasets. There is no international body (like UNO) registering the official definitions of all conturies, this is strictly a matter of bilateral agreements - and in many cases still of custom and practice (customary law) - at least for a precision of less then 100 meters and in more remote areas (deserts, swamps, forests, mountains, lakes etc.).\nSo every insititution that collects these data (like OSM) is not an official source any more by definition. If you really are to get official definitions, you can get them only at the national level.\nWhy it&#39;s difficult (if not impossible) to get a high precision, official dataset of worldwide borders\nTerritorial disputes: contested borders\nIn many cases, not even that does help much. Neighboring countries often have diverging definitions of what belongs to them and what to their neighbors. Georgia and Russia will have different definitions on their borders - not to speak about Crimea or the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan (not just about Nagorno Karabakh, but also their &quot;regular&quot; border like in this area).\nThis article makes it clear that no map is precise enough to establish a border - borders are\n\nestablished on the basis of international agreements.\n\nUnmarked segments of (uncontested) borders\nThere are many other cases: the delimitation of the borders between Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan in the Ferghana valley have been an issue for decades now. We not only speak about clear cases of contested territories, but also of generelly undisputed portions of the border that are not delimited: there are many unmarked segments of the border, thus no unanimously shared definition in the terrain (like boundary stone) does exist.\nOnly if both parts sign an agreement that fixes a border in all it&#39;s details (most often still based on real boundary stones put in the terrain by a bilateral commission) can we speak about an &quot;official&quot; border.\nMany borders date back decades (or even centuries), but back then have not been defined very clearly (or there are contradictory sources from different periods so that it remains unclear which one should be considered the &quot;correct&quot; one).\nIn many parts of the world, borders drawn by colonial powers are still source of contestations. See this academic paper on the unresolved delimitation of some central Asian republics, dating back to Russian and Soviet rule: Dr Mirzohid Rahimov &amp; Dr Galina Urazaeva: Central Asian Nations &amp; Border Issues. Conflict Studies Research Centre, 2005.\nSee also the following link where the distintiction between delimited and demarcated borders is explained:\n\n\ndelimited borders: properly fixed, the countries on either side have agreed to the exact physical location of the border, and the\ncoordinates of that physical line have been thoroughly and accurately\ndocumented\n\ndemarcated borders: physically marked on the landscape, with reinforced concrete pillars, anchored by underground footings.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/cameroon-nigeria-border-dispute\nOdd borders\nBorders can date back centuries: see the curious case of a small town on the border of the Netherlands and Belgium with literally dozens of enclaves and exclaves on both side which goes back to medieval times and an agreement from 1843.\nOther oddities, going back centuries, include condominiums like the Pheasant Island, which is part of Spain for the first half of each year and part of France for the second half of the year. Here as well, it&#39;s difficult to draw a 100% exactly border, as it changes over time.\nPeaceful territorial exchanges\nThere are not few cases of peaceful territorial exchanges on the local level ( a few hectares) that normally do not make headlines. These are often tiny adjustments of existing, but not clearly demarcated parts of the border or border segments that create some problems for the infrastructure, economy etc. Examples inclue a territorial exchange between Ukraine and Moldova or Uzbikistan and Kyrgyzstan or others including China. Also the hundreds of enclaves on the border between India and Bangladesh have resulted in border revisions.\nOfficial definition/documentation of borders difficult to access\nAs border zones tend to be a delicate issue for security concerns, many states ar not keen to publish official documentations about this delimitation. There are even cases when maps are deliberately wrong for such reasons - as this post explains for the example of China.\nA map in always all cases is a derivative product that documents one kind or another of border-definitions, but it is not the (legally binding) definition in itself - so to get the &quot;official&quot; source would meen going to the archives (if you have access) to access protocols on the delimitation and demarcation (like the ones of the Kyrgyz-Uzbek borders mentioned here).\nShifting borders or borders not clearly defined\nAnd even today, not even such protocols exist. Many borders are not defined in such a precise way, but are still based on older principles like &quot;in the middle of the river&quot; - riverbeds change, however. There are sections of the border between Switzerland and Italy that are defined as &quot;the ridge of a glacier&quot;. With climate change and melting glaciers, the border changes, too: Melting glacier in Alps shifts border between Switzerland and Italy.\nAs well, there is no agreed definition of the border between Switzerland and Germany in the Lake of Constance - as there is no need for it:\n\nthere is no legally binding agreement as to where the borders lie\nbetween the three countries.\nSee: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Constance#International_borders\n\nSee also this statement by Swisstopo (Swiss Federal Office of Topography):\n\nOur boundaries can change: Borders are commonly regarded as fixes, but depending on the terrain\nthey are subject to climatological changes and natural phenomena and\nmay thus change their course.\n\nhttps://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/knowledge-facts/sovereign-border/national-boundary/moving-boundaries.html\nSo even in the middle of Europe with it&#39;s sophisticated administrative institutions, high precision cartographic technologies, need for clear definitions in a denseily populated area and centuries-long tradition of border delimitation, borders to this day sometimes are still not defined &quot;on the meter&quot;. This is even more true for many parts of the world.\nCritical evalution of the very concept of &quot;official&quot;, detailed border\nSo I&#39;m not sure if the very concept you&#39;re after does makes sense. With no dataset you&#39;ll get a guarantee that it is correct or generally accepted. The more &quot;official&quot; and detailed the data gets, the more you&#39;ll get an illusion of precision and accuracy that in fact does not exist.\n",

When I import with matplot, the image loses its geographic coordinates. So the coordinates I have are just basic image coordinates (i.e. 250,312). What I need is to get the value of the pixel under the local maxima dot in the image (red dots in the image). Here in the forum I saw one guy asking the same thing (Getting pixel value of GDAL raster under OGR point without NumPy?), but he already had the points in a shapefile. In my case the points were computed with scikit-image (It is an array with the coordinates of each tree top). So I do not have the shapefile.\n\nIn conclusion, what I want in the end is a txt file with the coordinates of each local maxima in geographic coordinates, for example:\n\n525412 62980123 1150\n...\n\n\n",

            "body": "kappa does not quantifies the level of agreement between two datasets. It represents the level of agreement of two dataset corrected by chance. \n\nThe reason why you have a large difference between kappa and overall accuracy is that one of the classes (class 1) accounts for the large majority of your map, and this class is well described. Overall accuracy is therefore an optimistic index of the classifier performance, even if it is the true &quot;agreement&quot; in your case. As a trivial example, if I give you a map that says &quot;class 1&quot; everywhere, it will be 99% correct. Similarly, if 99% of the pixels are randomly assigned to &quot;class 1&quot;, the resulting map will still have a large agreement with your map. This is what kappa penalize with its &quot;c&quot; in the expression below (note that there are different kappa&#39;s, here is the most common). \n\nkappa = (OA-c)/(1-c), where e is the overall probability of random agreement\n\nOn your confusion matrix, you can see that classes 5 and 6 are always wrong and class 2 is not very reliable. This will have a large impact on your kappa index and this explains the large difference. The classifier is not better than chance for these classes. \n\nAs a remark, standard OA and kappa DO NOT take the distance between classes into account, so the fact that classes 5 and 6 are far off does not affect your results for any of those indices. Therefore, I suggest that you take advantage of the fact that your classes refer to quantities. The correlation between the two map could therefore make a good indicator. A confusion between 1 and 6 would then have more importance than a confusion between 1 and 2. Another way is to look at each class individually (user and producer accuracies). \n\nI do not agree on the fact that Kappa is largely considered to be more robust than OA. According to Pontius (2011), kappa has not provided the useful information that it is supposed to bring. \n\nEDIT : More recently, Olofsson, Foody, Herold, Stehman, Woodcock and Wulder (2014, Remote sensing of Environment) also advocated against kappa. Considering the importance of those authors, I would follow their recommendations.\n\n\n  The problems associated with kappa include but are not limited to: 1)\n  the correction for hypothetical chance agreement produces a measure\n  that is not descriptive of the accuracy a user of the map would\n  encounter (kappa would underestimate the probability that a randomly\n  selected pixel is correctly classified); 2) the correction for chance\n  agreement used in the common formulation of kappa is based on an\n  assumption of random chance that is not reasonable because it uses the\n  map marginal proportions of area in the definition of chance agreement\n  and these proportions are clearly not simply random; and 3) kappa is\n  highly correlatedwith overall accuracy so reporting kappa is redundant\n  with overall accuracy.\u201d (Foody, 1992; Liu et al., 2007; Pontius\n  &amp;Millones, 2011; Stehman, 1997). Consistentwith the recommendation in\n  Strahler et al. (2006) the use of kappa is strongly discouraged as,\n  despite its widespread use, it actually does not serve a useful role\n  in accuracy assessment or area estimation.\n\n",

The RSR describes the quantum\n  efficiency of a sensor at specific wavelengths over the range of a\n  spectral band. Currently, general descriptors, such as bandwidth and\n  average bandpass, are often the only spectral characteristics\n  considered in analysis of sensor spectral measurements. However,\n  cross-sensor wavelength variations in RSR can lead to measurement\n  discrepancies between sensor measurements that make them not directly\n  comparable (Teillet et al., 1997). In order to provide consistent\n  quantitative spectral measurements of vegetation land cover and\n  derived metrics, such as spectral vegetation indices, the effect of a\n  sensor\u2019s SRF must be considered and understood.\n  \n  [...]\n  \n  Spectral bands are often generalized (Pagnutti et al., 2003) in terms\n  of full width at half maximum bandwidth and central wavelength\n  corresponding to the maximum value of the response function (Liang,\n  2004) as shown in Figure 11.\n\n\n\n\nIn view of this, I was a bit surprised that, for example, the bandwidth of MODIS band 7 (dotted line) as defined here, seems to not match with the relative spectral response in the way defined above. \n\n\nIs my understanding of these concepts incorrect?\n",

Radiance is more complicated: exchange of energy (in the form of photons) across a given area of flat surface per time and then divided by the amount of steradians from which the &quot;given area&quot; is collecting light.\n\nThe author uses two figures to discuss Radiance and Irradiance with respect to Illuminance.\n\n\nAlso, a good reference may be The Light Handbook provides additional information.\nIn terms of remote sensing reflectance and water leaving radiance\nThis comment here\n\nRemote sensing reflectance (Rrs) contains the spectral colour information of the water body (below the sea surface). Rrs is the ratio between water-leaving radiance (Lw, above the sea surface) and downwelling irradiance (Ed, above the sea surface). Lw can be estimated from above-water radiometric measurements, in this case reflected skylight must be removed using a &quot;surface reflectance factor&quot; (rho).\nFurther comment: In ocean colour, often the term &quot;water-leaving reflectance&quot; (rho_w) is used instead of Rrs. The difference is:  rho_w = pi*Rrs (with related change in units)\n\nIllustration of light rays contributing to the irradiance reflectance\n\nIllustration of light rays contributing to the remote-sensing reflectance\n\n",

Furthermore, the impact of pansharpening may also be worth documenting as a partial side result in whatever study you are performing.

Having a MS opens doors in academia that would not normally exist with a BS.  For example, these are the education requirements for a mid-level research position in academia:  \n\n\n  Master\u2019s degree (or higher) in remote sensing, GIS, oceanography, or\n  related degree including a strong background in statistics,\n  mathematics, computer science, and/or engineering, and 2 years of\n  experience. \n  \n  OR \n  \n  Bachelor\u2019s degree in remote sensing, GIS, or related\n  science degree including a strong background in statistics,\n  mathematics, computer science, and/or engineering, and 5 years of\n  experience.\n\n\nLooking at the government sector, a MS is virtually required these days unless you have significant experience already.  The following are typical qualifications for a mid-level GIS job with the feds:\n\n\n  FOR THE GS-09 LEVEL, in addition to the educational requirements\n  listed above, applicants must have at least one year or twelve (12)\n  months of specialized experience equivalent to grade level GS-07 that\n  demonstrates:  work performing duties such as providing geographic\n  information systems (GIS) training and support with guidance for\n  resource conservation planning and the integration of GIS and planning\n  tools into daily operations; this would include business tools for a\n  variety of disciplines such as engineering, ecological, etc., and\n  other software applications as assigned; provide support with\n  assistance to state, field, and soil survey offices regarding ArcGIS,\n  soil data viewer, and other GIS software;  OR  applicants must have\n  two (2) years of progressively higher level graduate education leading\n  to a master&#39;s degree or master&#39;s or equivalent graduate degree\n  directly related to cartography.   Equivalent combinations of\n  education and experience are qualifying for this grade level.\n\n\nFor a mid-level private sector job (ESRI Support Analyst), the following requirements are nearly industry-wide:\n\n\n  Requirements:\n  \n  \n  Bachelor\u2019s in GIS, a related field, or equivalent work experience    while using GIS as a primary tool\n  \n  \n  Recommended Qualifications:\n  \n  \n  Master\u2019s in GIS, environmental science, geography, or other relevant    field\n  \n\n\nThe bottom line is a MS will jump start your career, provide increased opportunities and almost certainly yield a higher salary.\n",

            "body": "In remote sensing, ground sample distance (GSD) refers to the dimensions of a single pixel in an image as measured on the ground. The calculation of GSD uses the focal length (FL in figure below) and sensor array dimensions, which are properties of the sensor, as well as the distance between the sensor and the ground at the moment of image capture (D in figure below), normally represented by the altitude of an aircraft or orbital distance of a satellite.\nHere is a visual aid to illustrate:\n\nSo when the ground is flat, things are as you described and the distance D is similar across the entire image which means that spatial resolution and GSD are equal across the scene ((&quot;1&quot; above). However, since spatial resolution can be used to describe the dimensions of a pixel relative to any object in focus, consider two other scenarios. First, some objects can stand relatively high above the ground compared to the altitude of a low flying aircraft (&quot;2&quot; above). Second, image footprints can  cover large areas which contain variable surface relief (&quot;3&quot; above). In both of these scenarios, the spatial resolution of objects across the image would deviate from the correctly calculated GSD in such a way that objects closer to the sensor than the ground are more resolute, and those farther away are less resolute.\nSo in short, Spatial resolution refers to the size of the pixels in an image with respect to some real world object in focus, and GSD is a standardized metric used to describe the spatial resolution of remotely sensed imagery on the ground, while image resolution without georeferencing typically refers to solely to the number of pixels in the sensor array, which is the product of the height and width and usually expressed in megapixels (i.e., 8192 &#215; 5460 = ~45MP). The former two describe the size of the smallest detectable features within a particular image, while the latter describes the level of detail recorded by a particular sensor configuration.\n",

While expensive in a commercial setting, they have rather generous educational licensing, including the provision of free copies to educators for distribution to students, one per licensed seat per year.  I would advise at least ticking this box; I don&#39;t think people who learned GIS in other ways are less capable, but they might be less employable given the keyword-filtering resumes go through these days.  The extensions to ArcGIS range from basic things that should be integrated into the main application to the amusingly archaic to essential tools for a certain niche.\n\nThe OSGeo stack is an obvious addition to this, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s yet capable of being a full replacement in desktop GIS, at least not with the usability of Arc.  Due to constant complaining about ESRI&#39;s annoyances, I tried to replace it for an entire summer with mostly QGIS, and failed.  QGIS w/ plugins + GRASS + POSTGIS can be hacked around to achieve a lot of GIS functionality, I can believe that, but for learning GIS rapidly, I wouldn&#39;t recommend it.  There are a lot of different projects under the OSGeo heading, though - in all likelihood you&#39;ll find use for some of them even if you don&#39;t touch the desktop functionality.\n\nI&#39;m always seeing MapInfo installations mentioned, but the one I used wasn&#39;t really mature / feature-ful in the same sense ArcGIS has been.  The user interface was lacking, so perhaps it just hid the functionality from me.\n\nManifold has been highly regarded as an ArcGIS competitor that is at once commercially affordable, comprehensive, and extensively higher-performance than the sometimes antiquated ArcGIS code.  They seem to be dragging their feet on updates &amp; bug-fixes in the last few years, though.  At the least, if ArcGIS fails to operate on extreme datasets, try this.\n\nRS\n\nRemote sensing software is its own niche, with lots of features that aren&#39;t present in the ESRI stack.  I&#39;ve been exposed to ERDAS, and heard about ENVI and PCI.  Those three constitute a majority share, but I&#39;m aware that there are a decent number of options out there, some open source (I&#39;ve heard good things about Opticks).  In my own research area, 3D remote sensing is rapidly becoming a thing, as well - LIDAR and automated photogrammetry would be short topics in any RS course I&#39;d teach.  See: Meshlab, VSFM, &amp; Photoscan.\n\nCarto\n\nFor static-map cartography, you&#39;ll ideally want Adobe Illustrator, but there are several less expensive commercial choices that may suffice.  My experience with Inkscape is a lot like my experience with QGIS - almost there, but missing crucial features like an effective layer dialog.\n\nScripting\n\nIn the field of data manipulation, you&#39;ll definitely want to look at a thorough exploration of Python w/ LabPy.  It&#39;s too versatile not to teach as a general tool at this point, there&#39;s the added inducement of ArcPy, and RPy adds the capability to use basically every statistical algorithm in the world.  In addition, very big datasets are typically more amenable to a scripting environment than desktop GIS.\n\nCAD\n\nCAD &amp; CAD-like GIS software, often used for surveyors / engineers, has a broad number of options led by Autocad which I&#39;m not qualified to compare, but may not be necessary for a pure GIS program.\n\nClient - Server\n\nHosting client-server stacks, which becomes important for some classes of GIS user, is the last niche I&#39;m going to mention, but the requirements here are so varied as to make comparison difficult.  Other than ArcSDE, The software here is often free, but the server setup and sysadmin to use it is not.\n\nEDIT: I&#39;ve had the opportunity to revisit QGIS recently and it does seem to have considerably improved, going from 1.5 -&gt; 1.8, in stability &amp; features.\n",

See the Multiscale Curvature Classification (MCC) algorithm from Evans and Hudak (2007). It is said on page 4:\n\n\n  Negative blunders are a common occurrence in LiDAR data, which may be caused by the scattering of the photons in a returned laser pulse. Scattering lengthens the time for an emitted laser pulse to return to the aircraft sensor, inflating the calculation of distance traveled, hence causing a measurement\n  error where the surface elevation is erroneously recorded as being below the surrounding measurements. It should be noted that curvature classification approaches can potentially remove valid returns surrounding negative blunders, which can expand the edge artifact around a negative blunder to create a\n  distinct \u201cbomb crater\u201d effect. To address negative blunders, Haugerud and Harding suggested setting the curvature tolerance parameter to four times the interpolated cell size and selecting returns exceeding this negative curvature threshold. However, it should be noted that under certain circumstances, returns that appear to be negative blunders can be in fact valid\n  returns (e.g., sinkholes). Therefore, the preceding suggestion to remove potential negative blunders can be implemented as an optional last model loop to employ at the discretion of the user if needed.\n\n\nBelow there is a post with an example about using MCC-LIDAR:\n\n\nDetermining bare earth DEM from unclassified LAS file?\n\n\nOnce you have an accurate LiDAR ground point cloud to make an accurate DEM, it is possible to normalize the point cloud, and exclude points which are beneath the DEM surface (the ones with negative values). Using the same approach, it is also possible to address point number &#39;iii&#39; removing points above some fixed threshold. See, for example:\n\n\nDeleting anomalous points in *.lasd using ArcGIS for Desktop?\n\n\nThen, it leaves us with &#39;ii&#39;, which is addressed by AlecZ&#39;s answer recommending  from LAStools. It will also handle &#39;iii&#39;, and perhaps part of &#39;i&#39; as well (LAStools requires a license though). Other tools specifically created for checking/removing outliers were cited here: PDAL&#39;s  tool in Charlie Parr&#39;s answer which has a detailed explanation about how the tool works, and with the advantage PDAL is a free software.\n\nThen, what is left from the automated process (if any outlier) can be removed manually. For example:\n\n\n(LAStools; ArcGIS Pro) Cleaning LiDAR points that classification algorithm misses?\n(QT Modeler) --&gt; auslander&#39;s answer).\n\n\n\n\nEvans, Jeffrey S.; Hudak, Andrew T.  2007.

            "body": "When remote sensing vegetation, the time of year is very important. In most climates, vegetation has significantly more biomass (i.e., leaves etc.) during the summer, which means that it is easier for the sensor to discern the health of vegetation at that time of year. Two NDVI images of the same location from different times of the year may look different because they were taken at different points of the plants&#39; growing cycles. For this reason, and because of differences in illumination, it is advisable to use images from the same time of year when developing a multi-year time series.\n\nTo answer your question, the image above seems to do this. All of the images are taken during the summer over a number of years. When developing your time series, you should pick a time of year that you have good data for (ideally near the peak of plant growth) and then create single NDVI images of that date for each year from 2002 to 2013. When developing your final product, you can put the images side by side like the image above. You do not create an NDVI for each month and then create a composite of them. For the aforementioned reasons, the images from each month of the year would look very different and a composite wouldn&#39;t be effective to achieve what you want.\n\nThe values outputted by NDVI indicate the relative health and abundance of the vegetation by comparing reflectance values in the red and near infrared bands. The maps above seems to be indicating that the health and abundance of vegetation in Mongolia increased between 1989 and 2001. The individual maps do not indicate change in plant growth over time; only collectively do they show how plant growth has changed over time.\n",

However, the values for these cells are higher than expected, around 2000 depending on the band.

There are indications that the product has been derived from an even higher resolution data set; there is a 15 m resolution DEM for Japan. The coverage spans 82&#176;N to 82&#176;S. There are some voids in the current data that can be readily filled using other data sets such as SRTM. Like the SRTM data set, these data are described as a digital surface model since the heights of off-terrain objects (vegetation, buildings, etc) are included. The following is an example of an AW3D30 DEM of the Canadian Province of New Brunswick.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nJ. Takaku, T. Tadono, K.

Doing this for one property would give you an idea of the margin of error of the process, doing it for multiple properties will help you dial in the margin of error. That would be the process you are asking about in this above quote... but it still wont be admissible.\n\nYou could compare those results to the cadastral files to guage the margin of error, but once you have the cadastral file i&#39;m not sure i see the point of making another record/file. \n\nthe context might greatly change what is admissible.

            "body": "Doing this kind of processing is pretty straight-forward, but there are some tricks along the way that will determine how accurate your analysis will be. Your data will be generated from a slope raster of the area, and you usually have to build it yourself. The easiest way is to use a DEM raster to calculate the slope, so you should start with that.\n\nStep 1: Acquire the DEM\n\nYou can get DEMs for free from pretty much the entire world, and from many sources, depending on the area. But said you need a 90m&#178; resolution DEM, that&#39;s about a 9.5m pixel, which is pretty high where DEMs are concerned, and not readily available for free.\n\nYou said you were using ArcGIS Online&#39;s DEMs. Looking through their documentation, it appears they did a mosaic of DEMs ranging from 2m to 900m spatial resolution, you&#39;ll have to see if the cities you&#39;re working with are below the 10m range. Geospatial companies like Airbus and DigitalGlobe can generate a custom DEM for you, though a 9m res of 50km radius of 15 cities could be pretty expensive, you&#39;ll have to check with them.\n\nBut most of all, you have to ponder if you really need this resolution. Are you doing a precision work, or just a viability study? Because there are plenty of freely available DEMs within the 30m resolution, most famously the SRTM, that could fit on a broader study.\n\nIf you really need a 90m&#178; pixel, then another problem arises. There are two types of DEMs - the Terrain DEM, which covers only ground elevation, and the Surface DEM, which also covers tree tops, buildings, etc. You generally want a terrain DEM, smaller resolutions it matters less; on a &lt; 10m resolution DEM, however, it&#39;s a must, and DTMs (as they are known) are harder to generate and to come by. It&#39;s almost a certain that any freely available DEM will be surface.\n\nStep 2: Generating the slope\n\nWith your DEM in hand, you&#39;ll create the slope raster. Both ArcGIS and QGIS can do this, as well as any other good GIS or remote sensing software. But first, you need to know what Spatial Reference System your DEM raster is in. There are two types of SRS - geographic and projected. Geographic ones have coordinates in degrees (usually latitude and longitude), whereas projected ones have planar coordinates (usually meters).\n\nSince your elevation data is likely in meters, you need to make sure your coordinates are as well. If they&#39;re not, you&#39;ll need to convert (some softwares do that automatically whilst calculating the slope, but don&#39;t count on it). To convert in QGIS, go to Raster -&gt; Projection -&gt; Warp, and choose the projection that best suits your area (can&#39;t help you with that, but you can find this info online). In ArcGIS, you&#39;ll want the Project Raster tool that&#39;s in the Data Management toolbox.\n\nNext, you&#39;ll want to isolate your area of interest. Create a point vector for each of your city centers, and generate a 50km buffer from it. Again, make sure your point vector is in a projected SRS, else you&#39;ll create a 50 degrees buffer encompassing most of Eurasia. For QGIS, that&#39;s Vector -&gt; Geoprocessing Tools -&gt; Buffer, whereas for ArcGIS it&#39;s Analysis toolbox -&gt; Proximity toolset -&gt; Buffer. Remember to put it 50000, not 50. Then you&#39;ll need to cut your DEM raster with it. In QGIS, that&#39;s Raster -&gt; Extration -&gt; Clipper, and in ArcGIS it&#39;s Data Management toolbox -&gt; Raster toolset -&gt; Raster Processing toolset -&gt; Clip.\n\nWith your isolated DEM raster in hand, go generate the slope. In QGIS, that&#39;s Raster -&gt; Analysis -&gt; DEM, and then select Slope on the Mode. In ArcGIS, it&#39;s part of the Spatial Analyst toolbox and the 3D Analyst toolbox, under Surface toolset. Now, parts of both toolboxes are only available as payed extensions, and I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the case for Slope. Anyway, regardless of the software, slope can be calculated in degrees as well as percentage. Since you want areas with &lt; 15% slope, beware not to choose degrees during the process.\n\nStep 3: Analysing the slope\n\nNext, you&#39;ll turn your slope raster (in which currently pixels have a slope value) into a binary raster (that is, each pixel will either be 0 - non-acceptable slope - or 1 - acceptable slope). To do so, you&#39;ll need map algebra. In QGIS it&#39;s in Raster -&gt; Raster Calculator, and in ArcGIS it&#39;s Spatial Analyst toolbox -&gt; Map Algebra toolset -&gt; Raster Calculator. Your expression should be something like &quot;Raster1&quot; &lt;= 15.\n\nNow, what the sloping algorithm does is calculate the probable slope of each pixel based on the surrounding pixels. For a more in-depth view, read about it here. That may leave your area with a salt-and-pepper look after you turn it into binary, with plenty of isolated pixels of &quot;possible&quot; buildable land. If that&#39;s what you wanted, then you&#39;re done! If, however, you want a minimum contiguous area to be able to call it a building area, then you&#39;ll have to generalize your data.\n\nMany softwares do that, but, afaik, ArcGIS isn&#39;t one of them. But QGIS does, in Raster -&gt; Analysis -&gt; Sieve. Here you&#39;ll define the minimum number of pixels to be part of a set; any number smaller than that will be mixed with surrounding pixels. The number of pixels should be a reflection of the minimum area you want, based on the spatial resolution of the original DEM. Note, however, that this alters your accuracy somewhat, so use it with care.\n\nElse, this is it. You can later isolate water and wetland by overlaying a vector layer with those informations and further clipping your raster with it.\n",

            "body": "I am looking for a robust way to fill in missing values in some rasters. They all have a single layer. Missing values consist of single pixels to medium sized patches. Rasters are around 1000 x 1000 pixels in size and the largest patches are like 20x20 pixels.\nI&#39;m tempted to use aregImpute in the Hmisc R package.\nHas anyone used it for this purpose?\nthis approach looks seems very cool but I think it is only meant to produce aesthetically pleasing corrections.\nDetailed explanation of this:\nAll the rasters (I have 36 in total) share the same extent, they overlap and are aligned. Each raster is a different variable, I gathered variable from various sources (remote sensing, topographic and climatological). The original rasters come in various resolutions. The smallest being 30m. From there up they get as high as 1km. I resampled everything using cubic convolution (all the variables are continuos) to 1km. I have another 1km raster where I have data of a variable of interest for some sampled points. So I trained a model using those points and the other rasters as covariates to be able to generate a full raster of that variable. Unfortunately most covariate rasters have some missing values in them, actually not much but I would want to eliminate the problem entirely.\nI would like to use R for this.\n",
