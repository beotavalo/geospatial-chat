Google Maps and Bing maps extensions are also available, letting you use the ESRI API with Google/Bing maps (though this is true of most libraries).\nYahoo Map API&#39;s\nVia Michelin\nOpenLayers - Extensive documentation and a good amount of functionality plus the ability to use different map providers. \nMapquery - MapQuery has been released and now has some useful documentation It has the very worthwhile goal of combining OpenLayers and jQuery. If you&#39;re particularly keen on the idea of OpenLayers + jQuery, or if you want to contribute to a JavaScript Mapping Library then get involved and contribute your efforts. However if you just want to be an end user, or are new to this area it may not be for you.\nMapstraction - Makes things very simple, especially working with multiple basemap providers. However it is still a work in progress and the functionality is lacking in places, as is the documentation. (E.g. &quot;A GeoJSON object with the type \u201cFeatureCollection\u201d is a feature collection object.&quot; Not very informative.) It appears that it is still being actively developed but as of 4/4/11 there hasn&#39;t been a commit on Github since January.\ndeCarta - Has a mobile and desktop javascript - first is HTML5/CSS3 compliant and the second has more browser compatibility. Source code provided. Friendliest developer terms for a commercial API. You are allowed to brand the map and there are several different map styles. You can choose NAVTEQ or OSM data. They also have several Mobile APIs as well. - edited by TheSteve0 - a deCarta employee\nCloudmade\nPolymaps - Makes it very easy to composite raster and vector data from many different sources. Lets you easily add your own colouring, grouping, and interaction. Runs quickly, manages background tile loading well, and is only 30k of Javascript. One potential down side: it uses SVG which means it does not and will not work in MSIE 7 or 8. It works great in every other browser and should work in IE9\nJump - jump is a light weight maps library that works on its own, meaning, it is not a wrapper for OpenLayers or GoogleMaps API. Currently it is under development, but a lot of essential features work well.\nModestMaps - Another smaller, faster, newer JS mapping library from the makers of Mapbox and TileMill. \nMapiator\n\n\nOpenLayers is the one I am currently using. You can do a lot with it and it supports most data types. However it&#39;s not the best for everything. For example, Leaflet seems smoother in many ways, with image fading and other visual tweaks. If you&#39;re into jQuery you might like to check out MapQuery which is like a combination of jQuery and OpenLayers.\n",

It\n  should be treated as a special case and should not be viewed as the\n  type of question that is encouraged on this, or any Stack Exchange\n  site, but if you wish to contribute more content to it then feel free\n  to do so by editing this answer.\n\n\n\n\nFor non-GIS background devs creating single-function mapping apps - I&#39;d probably recommend Leaflet (now supported by MapBox). Easy to use and small. More functionality relies on plugins of varying quality and support. \n\nGIS online type application - use OpenLayers3 - has the full suite of data sources, controls etc. in a single library. It can also be used for simple mapping apps, so if you have a mix then I&#39;d use this for everything. \n\nGoogle still has the library/data combination (e.g. StreetView is not available anywhere else). \n\nEsri has GUI web app builders, and as noted below, why complicate things if you already use their stack. \n\nCommercial APIs (Google, Bing, Yahoo)\n\nUsing any commercial API leaves you at the mercy of whatever changes the provider makes to the API or Terms of Service. What happens for example if suddenly your local government portal that uses Google Maps suddenly has adverts popping up all over it? Want to reuse your JavaScript Google Maps code for an Intranet site? You&#39;ll find yourself having to pay the $10,000 licencing fee. \n\nMicrosoft often have more defined and fixed terms for their services (if paying) so there may be less of a risk here. \n\nThe recent backlash against Twitter is a good example of developers having an API that changed beneath them. If you aren&#39;t paying for a service then you (or your system) are the one being sold. \n\nGoogle started charging for use of their maps from October 2011. \n\nEsri\n\nAs others have mentioned if you are using an Esri stack then the ArcGIS API for JavaScript will no doubt work well on top of it. Coming from a GIS background Esri have probably thought more about traditional GIS tasks and features than the &quot;neo-geography&quot; web-giants (though this is just an opinion/feeling). \n\nOpenLayers has built in support for ArcGIS REST layers, and if you are looking to reuse your code for non-ESRI based websites then again an open API serves you best. \n\nUse OpenLayers...\n\nI can&#39;t really think why developers would use an API other than OpenLayers. Open Source projects lead to related Open Source projects so there are a wealth of reusable components out there such as the GeoExt library, MapQuery,  and GeoPrisma. \n\nI&#39;ll just add that just because a project is Open Source does not automatically make it better than commercial equivalents - but the OpenLayers API matches the commercial competition in this case, and the ability to see how the source works, the unit tests, the build scripts etc. mean that you can easily build new features on top of it. \n\nThere has been some recent criticism of OpenLayers, mainly related to complexity, styling, and size. There have been counter-arguments made to these here and here by Christopher Schmidt one of the lead developers of OpenLayers. \n\nIt is worth noting that if you need a simple Open Source mapping API then take a look at Cloudmade&#39;s Leaflet. \n\nThe comment smaller, faster, newer, and more straightforward can also be read as less features and less tested.\n\nScan the API documentation for Leaflet and OpenLayers. The latter includes items such as WFS layers, editing tools, and SLD support. It has also been tested in many different environments, and works in IE6 (allowing government and local authority users). \n\nFor simpler display of spatial data Leaflet looks ideal, and easier to get started. However I&#39;ll be sticking with OpenLayers for more feature-rich GIS applications. \n\nCaveats\n\nOne possible downside is often new innovations are seen first in commercial providers&#39; systems - however these nearly always filter through to OpenLayers in time. \n\nFinally I&#39;m sure there are certain scenarios where other APIs are more suitable - on custom hardware, to fit in with an organisations other IT systems, or if you already know an API inside-out and can get a system developed in half the time. \n\nAll the APIs you mentioned are capable of producing great online mapping systems, but your choice should also fit in with you or your company&#39;s future development needs. \n",

It\nshould be treated as a special case and should not be viewed as the\ntype of question that is encouraged on this, or any Stack Exchange\nsite, but if you wish to contribute more content to it then feel free\nto do so by editing this answer.\n\n\nThere are quite a few alternatives and I&#39;ve actually written a short book on the subject entitled &quot;Online GIS - Meet the Cloud Publication Platforms that Will Revolutionize our Industry&quot; but that&#39;s a little outdated now.\nHere&#39;s an updated summary:\nMangoMap: Very easy to use, no coding required. Lots of tools and functionality available to make really polished map applications. Much more competitive pricing than ArcGIS Online organisational accounts.\nGISCloud: Online alternative to traditional client/server GIS setup. Many features but hampered by a frustrating user interface.\nMapBox: Making maps sexy again. Programmer focused. Great for maps that need to fit a brand and be able to scale for high traffic. Good fit for consumer internet sites.\nCartoDB: Attractive UX and scales very well. Also lets you preserve the Google Maps experience for end users. Postgres + postgis database on the cloud with a set of API&#39;s on top of it to fetch/save and render data.\nDisclosure: Original answer posted by Founder of MangoMaps and includes  an edit by the CTO of CartoDB - these two products are described in this answer.\n\nI&#39;ve had good luck using GeoCommons for more lightweight mapping.\nThe upside is that the service is free within a certain limit, and includes some fairly powerful analysis tools. I believe any mapping is free if using or creating open data, and while my organization did not end up paying for the service, the prices seemed reasonable.\nI didn&#39;t realize until I visited today, though, that this service is now a part of esri, so their terms may have changed.\n",

(my favourite is Multilevel B-Spline interpolation)\nGeostatistics: residual analysis, ordinary and universal kriging, single and multiple regression analysis, variance analysis.\nGrid calculator: combine grids through user defined functions.\nGrid discretisation: skeletonisation, segmentation.\nGrid tools: merging, resampling, gap filling.\nImage classification: cluster analysis, box classification, maximum likelihood, pattern recognition, region growing.\nProjections: various coordinate transformations for vector and grid data (using Proj4 and GeoTrans libraries), georeferencing of grids.\nSimulation of dynamic processes: TOPMODEL, nitrogen distributions, erosion, landscape development.\nTerrain analysis: geomorphometrical calculations such as slope, aspect, curvatures, curvature classification, analytical hillshading, sink eliminition, flow path analysis, catchment delineation, solar radiation, channel lines, relative altitudes.\nVector tools: polygon intersection, contour lines from grid.\n\n\nAccording to the users it can partially replace commercial tools like Spatial analyst in ArcGIS and some people say, that the hydrological tools are even better than ArcHydroTools.\n\nIn my opinion it is good choice for people who are not familiar with GRASS and who need user friendly and free solution which can share data with other GIS tools.\n\nI use it together with QGIS and it works really nice - SAGA for raster data, QGIS for vectors and final map finishing and for quick mapping.\n",

            "body": "I am not sure if the context of your question is really on-topic here, but since the answer and its implications is very much relevant for travellers as well, I&#39;ll give it a try.\n\nThe explanation you have read is not entirely accurate. The problem is that accurate map material is neither allowed to be published, nor to leave the country. The Chinese National Bureau of Surveying and Mapping require all companies to obtain permits for map surveying and published map data must be obfuscated, resulting in a deviation of up to 700m between the map and the real world. Sounds strange, but that is how it is.\n\nYou can easily see the result of this obfuscation if you e.g. in Google Maps look at the satellite imagery with a map overlay. It is especially obvious in border proximity, where you will see that the map data for China is skewed, while the map outside China is correct. If you look at this area, the Shenzhen Bay with the border between China and Hong Kong, you can see that the map over Hong Kong in the lower right area is correct, while in the middle of the bay, the map seem to indicate that the bridge makes a sharp bend to the right, while you on the satellite image can see that the bridge in reality is straight. In the upper left area (mainland China), you can then see that there is a significant discrepancy between the imagery and the map. Roads seem to float on the water, pass through buildings and what else not.\n\nSome additional information based on questions in the comments:\n\nThe Chinese Surveying and Mapping Law does not explain why the restriction is in place. It is commonly quoted that it is for national security purposes, but I am not really sure if there is any official statement on that subject at all. Similar regulations and restrictions are actually quite common in many other countries as well, but usually do not apply to the entire country, just to &#39;places of interest&#39;.\n\nThe obfuscation algorithm is prespecified, not publicly known, but is obviously deterministic. Since a lot of example data is available, there have been attempts to reverse-engineer the algorithm and there are more or less reliable software libraries available allowing a backwards mapping from obfuscated to real coordinates. There is more information and links to further resources on the Wikipedia page &#39;Restrictions on geographic data in China&#39;.\n",

Unfortunately, most authors aren&#39;t putting their all or some of their work public. Also, there&#39;s been a couple small changes in carto, some of the code may not be 100% up to date or may not take advantage of carto&#39;s current capabilities and you&#39;ll also have to change things as people use different data types (postgis queries, shapefiles, json, etc) for your needs.\n\nhttps://github.com/andrewharvey/osm-hybrid-carto\n\nhttps://github.com/aaronlidman/Toner-for-Tilemill \n\nhttps://github.com/ajashton/simple-osm\n\nnice Transit map by Code for america participant jlord - https://github.com/codeforamerica/Transit-Map-in-TileMill \n\nhttps://github.com/mapbox/osm-bright - A great way to start learning carto.

You have to first convert your data source into a vector tile source before using it. \n\nThe following styles, written for use in Mapbox-Studio, use Mapbox-Streets as the source data unless noted. \n\nHigh-contrast black and white style similar aesthetics to Ello - viewable here  \n\nVetiver \n\nAn orienteering map made by Rafa of Mapbox - uses external data sources\n\nDarkly-Neon, from Stephen Smith \n\nn\\|/0, a Halloween-themed carto style that I made that uses numerous regular expressions.

Oddly, ArcGIS Server with SP1 applied returns a WKID of 102100 for a web mercator map service, but in the Services Directory, a web mercator map service has a spatial reference of &#39;102100 (3857)&#39;. EPSG has no entry for 102100. Not sure why Esri has chosen this route, but Esri&#39;s 102100 and 3857 are treated as equivalent by their products.\n\nEPSG - (no direct link)\n\n\n  Code: EPSG::2008.114\n  Reporter: OGP\n  Request: Revisit spherical mercator used for some web mapping applications\n  Actions Taken: Deprecated ellipsoid 7059, datum 6055, method 9841, projection 19847, CRSs 4055 and 3785, tfm 15973. Added methods 1024 and 1026, proj 3856 and projCRS 3857.\n  Entity Types Affected: Ellipsoid; Datum; Coordinate Operation Method; Coordinate Operation; Coordinate Reference System\n  Codes Affected: 7059; 6055; 9841; 15973 19847; 4055 3785\n  Report Date (UTC): 2008-12-11\n  Closed Date (UTC): 2009-02-10\n\n\nOpenLayers  - \n\n\n  Today, there is an officially registered EPSG code 3857 whose projection is identical to EPSG:900913. (http://www.epsg-registry.org/export.htm?gml=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::3857). So, if you need to combine overlay layers that are using either an alias or the official EPSG code with an OpenLayers SphericalMercator layer, you have to make sure that OpenLayers requests EPSG:3857 or other alias in stead of EPSG:900913.\n\n\nESRI - \n\n\n  @jamie - For a long time EPSG refused to assign a code to this coordinate system; therefore ESRI created the WKID codes 102113 and 102100.\n  When EPSG did assign a code, they used 3785, but later changed it to 3857. ArcGIS 10 will follow ESRI practice of using an EPSG code when one exists, and will advertise the coordinate system of the service as 3857. ArcGIS 10 and all Web APIs are being designed to recognize EPSG 3857, ESRI WKID 102113, and ESRI WKID 102100 as equivalent.\n\n",

Hsu, Edited by Manning\n\nThe difference from geometry and geographyc type:\n\n\n  &quot;PostGIS 1.5 introduced a new spatial type called geography, which uses geodetic\n  measurement instead of Cartesian measurement. Coordinate points in the geography\n  type are always represented in WGS 84 lon lat degrees (SRID 4326), but measurement\n  functions and relationships ST_Distance, ST_DWithin, ST_Length, and ST_Area always\n  return answers in meters or assume inputs in meters.&quot;\n\n\nWhat is best to use? It depends:\n\n\n  &quot;When choosing between the geometry and geography type for data storage, you should consider what you\u2019ll be using it for. If all you do are simple measurements and relationship checks on your data, and your data covers a fairly large area, then most likely you\u2019ll be better off storing your data using the new geography type. Although the new geography data type can cover the globe, the geometry type is far from obsolete. The geometry type has a much richer set of functions than geography, relationship checks are generally faster, and it has wider support currently across desktop and web-mapping tools.&quot;\n\n\nAlso, take a look in an already answered question here.\n",

You can edit shape files easily and use the built\nin gps if you have one, however it crashes my tablet if you are not\nlocated within the bounds of the map. Otherwise it is excellent and\nthe devs are working on python compatibility meaning you will be able\nto use google and bing maps as well as open streets etc.\nThe main issues are that the gui is designed for  a standard screen\nand all the buttons and icons are tiny on anything smaller than a 10&quot;\nscreen.\nFor basic navigation and data entry on a custom map, i was using\navenzas&#39; pdf maps on iOs, which imports geo-registered PDFs. They have\na beta for android which I haven&#39;t used but am planning on trialling.\nyou can make geo-registered pdfs in mapinfo or arcmap.\n\n\nSo far I have settled on collecting KML based vector data with limited attribution.\nApps I have used:\n\nLocus (free and paid version) https://market.android.com/details?id=menion.android.locus&amp;feature=related_apps\nOruxMaps https://market.android.com/details?id=com.orux.oruxmaps\nGoogle Tracks (pre-installed on my phone)\n\nLocus and Orux allow connecting to WMS services, Google/Bing, etc... I believe there is a separate add-on to allow Google maps in Locus.\n\nI came across this interesting application that looks (have not used it) interesting for collection of data.\nhttp://code.google.com/p/geopaparazzi/\nSome more info:\nGeopaparazzi is a tool developed to do very fast qualitative engineering/geologic surveys. Even if the main aim is in the field of surveying, it contains tools that can be of great use also to OpenStreetMappers as well as tourists that want to keep a geo-diary. Geopaparazzi is available on the Android Market.\nTo get started jump into the documentation section: https://code.google.com/p/geopaparazzi/wiki/Docs\nThe main aim of Geopaparazzi is to have a tool that:\n\nfits in any pocket and can be always at hand, when needed\ngives the possibility to take georeferenced and possibly orientated pictures during the survey, with further possibility to import them into the main GIS application BeeGIS\nis able to exploit easily internet connection, if available.\nis extremely easy to use and intuitive, providing just few important functionalities.\n\nThe main features available in Geopaparazzi are:\n\ngeoreferenced notes\ngeoreferenced and orientated pictures\ngps tracks logging\neasy export of collected data\na map view for the navigation of the environment\n\nThis recent presentation might give more insight: http://www.slideshare.net/moovida/geopaparazzi-state-of-the-art\n\nWe develop a mobile GIS solution for Android tablets called Mappt, which has a free trial available from the Google Play store.  The trial version allows you access to all functionality of the software, with the exception that you can not export your data.\nYou can grab the trial for free from the Google Play Store:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.mappt\nWith Mappt, you can:\n\nCapture and work with your vector data offline.\nImport and export in Shapefile and KML formats.\nWork with WGS84 and UTM-based Coordinate Reference Systems.\nImport directly from Google Drive and export to email.\nImport your own large imagery, fully available offline, via the ArcGIS Compact Cache Bundle format.  We are also actively implementing other options to import imagery.\nRecord GPS paths.\nDefine geofences, with audible and visual alerts.\n\nSee the Mappt website for further information: www.mappt.com.au\n\n\n\nFulcrum is a cost-effective and customizable GIS mobile data collection platform. Includes a 30-day trial at sign up!\nhttp://fulcrumapp.com/\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spatialnetworks.fulcrum&amp;hl=en\n\n\nI&#39;m working on this and I have just published a GIS application: ItacaMap for Android ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.itacasoft.itacamap ). At the moment you can see basic functionality (zoom, pan, view info, browse, select by rectangle, etc.), but I have already implemented edit functionalities (at least on the server side) and more is cooking.\n\nGeospago is a new application.  It is a software-as-a-solution (SaaS) because it has a mobile application working in conjunction with a web application.  Both may be used for collecting/inputting data, editing/updating data, viewing/sharing data, and importing/exporting data.  The web portal runs on amazon with geoserver and syncs with the android app, which uses SQLite.\nThe web portal is used to invite/manage users, control user access to projects, create projects and custom forms, deploy the forms to users, and manage data.  It can import SHP &amp; CSV files for data maintenance workflows.  It can export data to the standard formats (CSV, KML, SHP), but aslo provides feeds and an API.  This allows users to add a WFS feed to ArcMap or QGIS to see the data live from the cloud, a network link to Google Earth, or create your own script to pull the data through API requests to integrate with other systems.  Collecting data is easy as well as quickly getting new or updated data back into a enterprise system of record.  Geospago is the only app I have seen so far that provides this.\nThe mobile app is used to collect, view, and edit data (point, line, and polygon).  It runs on both phones and tablets.  It handles connected and disconnected environments through the use of mbtiles.  It allows multiple photos to be attached to a single record.  It also has barcode scanning and signature capabilities.  Synchronization is set to user specified intervals or can be manually forced.  This prevents overlap and duplication if you have multiple people collecting data for the same projects in connected areas.\nGeospago is very affordable and available on a monthly, per-license pricing model that it can be frozen between projects or cancel-at-any-time basis so you can use it only when you need it.  Data is secure on Amazon cloud and can be download it at any time.\nThe Geospago website has more information and has a sign up link.  The website also has a link to the mobile app on the Google Play Store.\n\nFound an app called MapItFast that is easy to use.  A free version that lets you gather point, line, polygon features and even photos.  I&#39;ve used it for its basemaps and to calculate distance and area.  Unfortunately, the data stays on the device (no way to export or share..that I can find) without upgrading to the cloud services.  But that looks interesting since data can be exported to CSV, GPX, SHP and KMZ, it has built in synchronization to collaborate on mapping and location, full attribution, editing, and probably a bunch of other stuff I don&#39;t know about yet.  Might be useful to those folks doing group mapping on an Android and wanting a way to get it into Google Maps or ArcGIS.  I like the idea of a low cost Internet Map Server and tools.\nTheir website (http://www.mapitfast.com) has YouTube video.  I downloaded from Google Play.

I am happy using Python for any portion of this and I imagine SPSS or R being used to run the PCA on the geographically weighted variables.\n\nMy dataset is composed of roughly 30 independent variables that are measured throughout ~550 census tracts (vector geometry).\n\nI know this is a loaded question. But, as I search and search, there does not seem to be any solutions out there. What I have come across are mathematical equations that explain the fundamental composition of GWPCA (and GWR). What I am after is more applied in a sense, that I am looking for what major steps I need to accomplish to get from raw data to the GWPCA results.\n\n\n\nI would like to expand on the first part with this edit due to the comments received below.\n\nTo address Paul...\n\nI am basing my interest in GWPCA off of the following paper:\n\nLloyd, C. D., (2010). Analysing population characteristics using geographically weighted principal components analysis: A case study of Northern Ireland in 2001. Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 34(5), p.389-399.\n\nFor those who do not have access to the literature, I have attached screenshots of the particular sections which explain the mathematics below:\n\n\n\nAnd to address whuber...\n\nWithout going into detail (confidentiality), we are attempting to reduce the 30 variables, which we believe are all very good indicators (albeit globally), to the set of components with eigenvalues greater than 1. By computing the geographically weighted components, we attempt to understand the local variances explained by these components.\n\nI think our primary goal will be to proof the concept of GWPCA, that is, show the spatially explicit nature of our data and that we cannot consider all independent variables to be explanatory on a global scale. Rather, the local scale (neighbourhoods) that each component will identify will aid us in understanding the multi-dimensional nature of our data (how variables can be combined with one another to explain a certain neighbourhoods in our study area).\n\nWe hope to map the percentage of variance accounted for by each component (separately), to understand the extent of the neighbourhood explained by the component in question (aid us in understanding local spatiality of our components). Perhaps some other mapping examples but none come to mind at the moment.\n\nAdditionally:\n\nThe mathematics behind the GWPCA is beyond what I understand given my background in geographic analysis and social statistics. The application of the maths is most important, that is, what do I plug in to these variables/formulas.\n",

            "body": "This seems like a good place to describe a simple, fast, and more than reasonably accurate way to compute slopes for a globally extensive DEM.\nPrinciples\nRecall that the slope of a surface at a point is essentially the largest ratio of &quot;rise&quot; to &quot;run&quot; encountered at all possible bearings from that point. The issue is that when a projection has scale distortion, the values of &quot;run&quot; will be incorrectly computed. Even worse, when the scale distortion varies with bearing--which is the case with all projections that are not conformal--how the slope varies with bearing will be incorrectly estimated, preventing accurate identification of the maximum rise:run ratio (and skewing the calculation of the aspect).\nWe can solve this by using a conformal projection to ensure that the scale distortion does not vary with bearing, and then correcting the slope estimates to account for the scale distortion (which varies from point to point throughout the map).  The trick is to use a global conformal projection that allows a simple expression for its scale distortion.\nThe Mercator projection fits the bill: assuming scale is correct at the Equator, its distortion equals the secant of the latitude.  That is, distances on the map appear to be multiplied by the secant.  This causes any slope calculation to compute rise:(sec(f)*run) (which is a ratio), where f is the latitude.  To correct this, we need to multiply the computed slopes by sec(f); or, equivalently, divide them by cos(f).  This gives us the simple recipe:\n\nCompute the slope (as rise:run or a percent) using a Mercator projection, then divide the result by the cosine of the latitude.\n\nWorkflow\nTo do this with a grid given in decimal degrees (such as an SRTM DEM), perform the following steps:\n\nCreate a latitude grid.  (This is just the y-coordinate grid.)\n\nCompute its cosine.\n\nProject both the DEM and the cosine of the latitude using a Mercator projection in which scale is true at the Equator.\n\nIf necessary, convert the elevation units to agree with the units of the projected coordinates (usually meters).\n\nCompute the slope of the projected DEM either as a pure slope or a percent (not as an angle).\n\nDivide this slope by the projected cosine(latitude) grid.\n\nIf desired, reproject the slope grid to any other coordinate system for further analysis or mapping.\n\n\nThe errors in the slope calculations will be up to 0.3% (because this procedure uses a spherical earth model rather than an ellipsoidal one, which is flattened by 0.3%).  That error is substantially smaller than other errors that go into slope calculations and so can be neglected.\n\nFully global calculations\nThe Mercator projection cannot handle either pole.  For work in polar regions, consider using a polar Stereographic projection with true scale at the pole.  The scale distortion equals 2 / (1 + sin(f)).  Use this expression in place of sec(f) in the workflow. Specifically, instead of computing a cosine(latitude) grid, compute a grid whose values are (1 + sin(latitude))/2 (edit: use -latitude for the South Pole, as discussed in the comments).  Then proceed exactly as before.\nFor a complete global solution, consider breaking the terrestrial grid into three parts--one around each pole and one around the equator--, performing a slope calculation separately in each part using a suitable projection, and mosaicing the results.  A reasonable place to split the globe is along circles of latitude at latitudes of 2*ArcTan(1/3), which is about 37 degrees, because at these latitudes the Mercator and Stereographic correction factors are equal to each other (having a common value of 5/4) and it would be nice to minimize the sizes of the corrections made.  As a check of the computations, the grids should be in very close agreement where they overlap (tiny amounts of floating point imprecision and differences due to resampling of the projected grids ought to be the only sources of discrepancies).\nReferences\nJohn P.

The other major caveat is your web development experience, and what language you prefer or have an interest in.\nI think the best way to answer your question is to provide a nice listing of API&#39;s available to you.  Here are three that come to mind.  These are not by any means all of them!\nArcGIS\nAPIs:\n\nJavaScript\nEsri Leaflet\nSilverlight (please see this blog post on last release notes)\nFlex (please see this blog post on last release notes)\n.NET\n...and more (see here)\n\nPros:\n\nThe Experience Builder solution provides one of the most dynamic non-coding web application building experience on the market\nThe Web AppBuilder has made creating web map applications very simple for those not well-versed in web development\nEasy to use application builders (Flex, Silverlight, and JavaScript, just be mindful of the deprecation plans)\nExpansive online forums (Plenty of Stack Exchange Posts)\nWith many solutions available within the ArcGIS stack that require little to no development work, ArcGIS can also be a good choice for deploying solutions in a timely manner.\nGitHub repositories for many of the solutions\n\nCons:\n\nPrice (not for use of API&#39;s, but more-so if you want to publish your own data, also see ArcGIS Online)\nCustomizing application code can be cumbersome\n\nSummary:\nArcGIS has a lot to offer for web GIS products, and has many resources to help you along the way.  Just be aware of the potential costs you run into when wanting to publish your own data.\nGoogle\nAPIs:\n\nJavaScript\nMobile (Android, iOS)\n\nPros:\n\nBy far the most recognized name in web mapping\nExpansive JavaScript API\nMany online samples\nRecently, Google released their Pricing and Plans, which is a great breakdown of services offered\n\nCons:\n\nPotential licensing issues (read up on the terms of service)\nRestrictions on web services\n\nSummary:\nGoogle has a strong name in the market and pretty reliable online services.  Just be sure to understand the ins and outs of their usages, so you don&#39;t step on any legal toes.  The new Pricing and Plans page is quite helpful in that regard.\nOpen Source\nAPIs (all JavaScript based):\n\nLeaflet\nOpenLayers\nGeoServer\n\nPros:\n\nVery easy to use and completely free\nEver growing API\nEver growing developer base with custom plugins being published all the time\nTutorials for beginners\n\nCons:\n\nOfficial support is not as well known BUT the community involved is more than helpful (perhaps even better than commercial GIS support)\n\nSummary:\nOpen Source is truly a great option for anyone who wants to test the waters of Web GIS.  With changes and enhancements made every day in the community, open source can be the inexpensive way to address your geospatial needs.\n\nAs I said, this is not all of the choices you have, but at least now there is a post with links for yourself and others to get familiar with some of the major players in the Web GIS world.\n",

            "body": "I see MerseyViking has recommended a quadtree. I was going to suggest the same thing and in order to explain it, here&#39;s the code and an example.  The code is written in  but ought to port easily to, say, Python.\n\nThe idea is remarkably simple: split the points approximately in half in the x-direction, then recursively split the two halves along the y-direction, alternating directions at each level, until no more splitting is desired.\n\nBecause the intent is to disguise actual point locations, it is useful to introduce some randomness into the splits. One fast simple way to do this is to split at a quantile set a small random amount away from 50%. In this fashion (a) the splitting values are highly unlikely to coincide with data coordinates, so that the points will fall uniquely into quadrants created by the partitioning, and (b) point coordinates will be impossible to reconstruct precisely from the quadtree.\n\nBecause the intention is to maintain a minimum quantity  of nodes within each quadtree leaf, we implement a restricted form of quadtree.  It will support (1) clustering points into groups having between  and 2*-1 elements each and (2) mapping the quadrants.\n\nThis  code creates a tree of nodes and terminal leaves, distinguishing them by class.  The class labeling expedites post-processing such as plotting, shown below.  The code uses numeric values for the ids. This works up to depths of 52 in the tree (using doubles; if unsigned long integers are used, the maximum depth is 32).  For deeper trees (which are highly unlikely in any application, because at least  * 2^52 points would be involved), ids would have to be strings.\n\n\n\nNote that the recursive divide-and-conquer design of this algorithm (and, consequently, of most of the post-processing algorithms) means that the time requirement is O(m) and RAM usage is O(n) where  is the number of cells and  is the number of points.   is proportional to  divided by the minimum points per cell, .  This is useful for estimating computation times. For instance, if it takes 13 seconds to partition n=10^6 points into cells of 50-99 points (k=50), m = 10^6/50 = 20000. If you want instead to partition down to 5-9 points per cell (k=5), m is 10 times larger, so the timing goes up to about 130 seconds.  (Because the process of splitting a set of coordinates around their middles gets faster as the cells get smaller, the actual timing was only 90 seconds.) To go all the way to k=1 point per cell, it will take about six times longer still, or nine minutes, and we can expect the code actually to be a little faster than that.\n\nBefore going further, let&#39;s generate some interesting irregularly spaced data and create their restricted quadtree (0.29 seconds elapsed time):\n\n\n\nHere&#39;s the code to produce these plots.  It exploits &#39;s polymorphism:  will be called whenever the  function is applied to a  object, for instance.  The power of this is evident in the extreme simplicity of the function to color the points according to their cluster identifier:\n\n\n\nPlotting the grid itself is a little trickier because it requires repeated clipping of the thresholds used for the quadtree partitioning, but the same recursive approach is simple and elegant.  Use a variant to construct polygonal representations of the quadrants if desired.\n\n\n\nAs another example, I generated 1,000,000 points and partitioned them into groups of 5-9 each.  Timing was 91.7 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an example of how to interact with a GIS, let&#39;s write out all the quadtree cells as a polygon shapefile using the  library.  The code emulates the clipping routines of , but this time it has to generate vector descriptions of the cells.  These are output as data frames for use with the  library.\n\n\n\nThe points themselves can be read directly using  or by importing a data file of (x,y) coordinates.\n\nExample of use:\n\n\n\n(Use any desired extent for  here to window into a subregion or to expand the mapping to a larger region; this code defaults to the extent of the points.)\n\nThis alone is enough: a spatial join of these polygons to the original points will identify the clusters. Once identified, database &quot;summarize&quot; operations will generate summary statistics of the points within each cell.\n",

            "body": "General\n\nGeographers among other scientists seek for geographical patterns hoping that this will help them to better understand the processes that have produced these patterns. As you shown, this process begins with the mapping of the locations at which the phenomena are located. Oftentimes, such maps as you have produced above are known as point pattern maps.\n\nSpatial distribution\n\nWhen a reader examines such a map, she is trying to find the spatial distribution (or the spatial or geographic arrangement) of the variable of interest and whether there is any sort of pattern. Usually, there are four types of distribution that are defined for point pattern map (which you have also drawn above). These are:\n\n\nclustered\nnormal\nrandom \nregular/uniform/dispersed\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n \n\nBeside the visual investigation, one often needs to use the analysis of frequency or the density of points across a region (done with the help of quadrat analysis) or of the distance between adjacent points (done with the help of nearest neighbor analysis).\n\nModifiable units problem\n\nYou have also mentioned the Modifiable areal unit problem (also known as modifiable units problem). \n\n\n  In spatial analysis, four major problems interfere with an accurate\n  estimation of the statistical parameter: the boundary problem, scale\n  problem, pattern problem (or spatial autocorrelation), and modifiable\n  areal unit problem (Barber 1988)\n\n\nI think it&#39;s relevant in this example, but I would also like to mention some other problems:\n\nBoundary problem\n\n\n  A boundary problem in analysis is a phenomenon in which geographical\n  patterns are differentiated by the shape and arrangement of boundaries\n  that are drawn for administrative or measurement purposes.\n\n\nFor a simple example, if you have your points representing a number of people of a certain ethnic group, depending on the boundaries used you might get a different view on the distribution of the points among, for instance, census districts.\n\nIf the points are located close to each other yet are located in different census districts, you can get a false understanding of the distribution because it would indicate even distribution of the ethnic group in this study area. In contrast, if you would use some other boundaries, you might get another view that indicates significant areal concentration of the ethic group. In the end, you might be confused whether you observe ethnic segregation or ethnic integration.\n\nModifiable units problem\n\nThis can be discussed in two aspects - in terms of the &quot;scale&quot; and the &quot;shape&quot;.\n\nScale problem\n\nValues for various descriptive statistics can vary in a systematic manner when you use more and more aggregated areal data.\n\nA simple illustration: each cell is our polygon area with the count of points.\n\n6&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;10&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;3&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;\n5&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;\n2&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;\n6&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;\n4&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;\n12&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;\n3&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;\n5&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;\n8&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;\n12&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;\n4&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;\n12&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;\n1&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;\n3&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;\n\nThen we aggregate the polygons to get an average number of points:\n\n8&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;4&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;\n4&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;\n8&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;\n4&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;\n10&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;\n8&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;\n2&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;\n\nAnd one more time:\n\n6&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;\n6&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;\n6&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;\n6&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;\n\nHey, we got an even distribution! In a word: spatial aggregation usually tends to minimize the variation shown on a map.\n\nFor another really simple example, it really depends at what scale you are looking at your points. Look at the Wikipedia image for point pattern; the normal distribution might look as clustered one when you zoom out in your digital map. \n\nShape problem\n\nWe could have aggregated the polygons in the table above using vertical or horizontal (joining contiguous north-south rather instead of east-west neighbors). This means that various areal definitions might have a significant impact on the values of your data distribution and descriptive statistics.\n\nThe pattern problem\n\nIn short, the above mentioned methods are not very good at evaluating the type of problem that a human would read easily on a map. To be able to distinguish between the areal patterns and point distributions, one would need to use the spatial autocorrelation methods).\n",

            "body": "This is a great question because it uncovers important sources of common misunderstandings.  The brief answer is that although of course geodetic latitude and longitude are a form of latitude and longitude, they are not the only ones and the differences are not trivial, so we should be cautious not to confuse them.\n\nIn all cases, latitude and longitude are numbers used to designate points on the earth&#39;s surface.  Usually, the definition of longitude is straightforward because all but the most detailed models of the earth&#39;s surface assume it is rotationally symmetric.  (Geoids, which account for gravitational anomalies, are a possible exception, but this level of detail is normally used only to develop precise elevation coordinates without modifying the underlying latitude and longitude.)  Lines of longitude are meridians and can be designated by the angle they make with a designated meridian of origin, a &quot;prime meridian.&quot;\nThere are many different kinds of latitude.  They are best discussed in a context where an ellipsoidal model of the earth is given, such as the WGS84 or GRS80 ellipsoids.  The latitude depends on the reference ellipsoid.  (This is important when using data referenced to historical ellipsoids, such as the Clarke 1866 ellipsoid.  With more recent ellipsoids, established through satellite measurements, the differences are so small as to be of interest only when accuracy and precision needs are extremely high (sub meter).)\n\nGeodetic latitude is the (signed) angle between the local normal (&quot;straight up&quot; direction) and the plane of the equator.  This should be a professional&#39;s default understanding of what a &quot;latitude&quot; means, even though it differs from the definition taught to children--and therefore is the common understanding among laymen--which corresponds to the geocentric latitude (for a spherical model).  The two can differ by tens of kilometers, a sizable fraction of one degree.\n\nGeocentric latitude, on the other hand, is the (signed) angle determined by the direction from the center of the earth to the point.  The distinction between geocentric and geodetic latitudes is illustrated in the links and also in my reply at How do you compute the earth&#39;s radius at a given geodetic latitude?.\n\nAdditional latitudes have been defined to help create accurate maps that have particular properties, such as being conformal, equal-area (&quot;authalic&quot;), or isometric.  (By changing the latitude slightly we &quot;project&quot; the ellipsoid onto the sphere and then we apply a projection from the sphere to the plane to make a map.  This last step is relatively simple, because it does not need to handle the complicated ellipsoidal formulas, while the initial change of latitude increases the overall accuracy of the map.)\n\nAn &quot;isometric latitude&quot; isn&#39;t even in degrees; it&#39;s essentially the northing coordinate for a Mercator projection.\n\n\nWhen we change the model of the earth (the reference ellipsoid), we obtain a different set of latitudes altogether.  Frequently this happens when a latitude based on an ellipsoid is considered to be a latitude based on a spherical model.  I recently analyzed the resulting error at How accurate is approximating the Earth as a sphere?, finding the displacements (between the correct location designated by a latitude and the apparent location) can be as great as 20 km.  Differences among the various latitudes in use (see &quot;additional latitudes&quot; above) can be of the same order of magnitude, so even for very rough mapping purposes one should pay attention to what is going on.\n\nAdditional references\nA good, but highly technical, source of information on many forms of latitude is\nBugayevskiy, Lev M. &amp; John P. Snyder, Map Projections, A Reference Manual.  Taylor &amp; Francis, London (1995).\nSee pp. 33-37 for formulae and Appendix 5 for a table of isometric latitudes.\n",

Pre to Post drive route matching could be done with much ease by buffering either of the plot to GPS error or bin distances (whichever is high per se ~20 m) such that Pre or Post plot could be clipped out and bin comparison could be done appropriately and hence benchmarking. QGIS has on-the-go layer styling while on processes (Copy/Past) of thematic properties which are saved in different active layer or saved on local m/c (user accessible and editable by Text editor like NotePad++, Submlime etc.), and thematics are also shareable between team etc. \n\n\n\n\nSample RSRP thro&#39; simple Pathloss calculations on omini directional radiation pattern (Bin / Point map with 100 m interval has been created along Indian railways line vector), individual distance (multi-ring buffer) could be utilized to represent the coverage prediction plot (Constraints omitted: Antenna tilts, Elevations, Reflections, Absorption, and many others):\n\n\nRepresentation of drive plot from regular coverage contours:\n\n\nDraw regular distance &quot;multi-ring buffer&quot; from chosen site location (lat long) to make variable distance rings around the given point, dissolving the distance buffers would facilitate representation better\nGenerate points along line vectors\nClip points vector over multi-distance ring buffer to pick corresponding distances to the site \nUse appropriate RF model formula to calculate free space pathloss and represent bin\nUse viewshed approach to involve Ground Elevation in prediction (*Currently under exploration)\nUse Antenna Tilts, Antenna pattern (*Currently under exploration)\nUse Clutter absorption model (*Currently under exploration)\n\n\n\n\nApply COST 231 (Urban RF propagation model) in association with distance calculated through MultiRingBuffer from site centroid.

            "body": "It seems the most common problem with these types of &quot;flow maps&quot; is that when many lines are included, they collide to such a great extent that it makes it difficult to discern any non-obvious pattern (when reciprocal flows are considered it happens to an even greater extent). Also the long lines tend to dominate the graphic, although it is quite possible the distribution of flows is predominately over short spaces (for instance a host of different distributions between places tend to be similar to Levy flights). I suppose this isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing (the long lines may be more intrinsically interesting that the short lines for many phenomenon), but I don&#39;t think we want to lose the forest for the trees so to speak.\nAlthough I don&#39;t doubt I&#39;ve missed some potential &quot;solutions&quot; that have been proposed, I will try to sum up some of the ways individuals have tried to solve the problem in work that I have come across.\nDistorting the Lines\nIf you peruse some of the other threads on the sight you will see some examples of how people have dealt with this problem. In particular, the lines are distorted so they don&#39;t overlap with each other or other objects on the map. Whuber&#39;s answer on another similar question (already mentioned in a comment) is an example of this. A presentation by some researchers at Stanford demonstrates this same idea (Phan et al., 2005). Thanks for that presentation goes to dslamb for this answer on another thread (and all of the answers to that thread will be on interest for your question as well). I particularly find it interesting that one of the cardinal examples of this is the old immigration map by Minard is an example of a desirable output (circa 1864!).\nGiven your particular use case (small number of nodes and lines), this seems sufficient. The other &quot;solutions&quot; I present are more intended to visualize data with many lines and many origins-destinations (although I assume they will be useful summaries for the community in general, so I continue on regardless).\nUsing Alpha Blending, Color, and Line Width/Height\nThe maps I listed in that same thread previously noted, Representation of network flows are examples of these. The facebook friends is a good case of adjusting the alpha level of lines, so it takes many more flows to represent a darker (or brighter in that case) connection between the two places. This also demphasizes the longer lines because they tend to happen more infrequently. Similar logic comes from Value-by-Alpha maps for polygon areas (Roth et al., 2010) that have been mentioned on this forum before.\nThe other map I present in that same answer uses color, and a non-traditional 3d perspective arcing lines (Ratti et al., 2010). The authors used a clustering criteria to group homogenous areas together and color code them (so by definition the areas within the color have more similar flow patterns than between colors). The clustering criteria in and of itself could be interesting to identify patterns in the data, although it seems a likely problem with this, as Andrew Gelman has mentioned, is that it tells you pretty much what you already know, that places nearer to each other tend to have more connections.\nLastly, in this category I include techniques that weight the lines (similar to alpha blending) using either the line width, or in the case of the 3d perspective line height, to convey the volume of the flow. See the page on Tobler&#39;s flow mapping software page for some examples in 2d (and the other article I mentioned is an example in 3d using line heights). Also on that page Tobler has a very useful article describing the problems with flowmapping and their historical application (Tobler, 1987).\nAnother example in 3d is this answer by a mankoff on this site. This post on the Sociological images blog shows a useful way in a flow diagram to distinguish between in-flows and out-flows (although again it works because the number of nodes and relatively small, and the nodes on the network can be layed out in an arbitrary way to reduce overplotting). Those same types of arrows (and a few others using hashings) are also in (Tobler, 1987).\nIn the end though line width and color don&#39;t really solve the over-plotting problem. The arcs in 3d help somewhat, although with more complicated flow patterns I think they will have limited utility. IMO alpha blending seems to be the most useful in a wide variety of situations of these three, but color and line width could/should be used in conjunction with line distortion mentioned above.\nData Reduction\nI group two types of techniques here, 1) using small multiple maps (i.e. many maps with inherently less objects to visualize so overplotting is reduced), or 2) other graphical representions, that are not lines, but represent some of the flows via density or choropleth maps. Examples of these can be found in (Corcoran et al., 2009; Rae, 2009; Wood et al., 2010) (thanks to iant for the Rae reference). These tend to reduce the amount of visual information presented by either presenting a series of small multiple maps (or just a smaller area), or use a choropleth mapping scheme to represent some statistic (examples could be number of in-flows, number of outflows, direction of the flows, average distance of the flows). If you have point level data you could represent these statistics through kernal density raster maps, or aggregate them into quadrats.\nWhen information is reduced like this, overplotting isn&#39;t as much a problem. A very cool interactive online example is this migration map by Forbes magazine. You can only see one county at a time, but the reduction of information makes it much easier to parse the lines (and the difference between in-flows and out-flows). A recent post on the ESRI mapping blog also uses a similar technique with the small multiples (they also choose a particular projection for the world map to have &quot;pretty looking&quot; lines, and make good use of color to further highlight different international origins). In that example it works out pretty well because the end destination is the same for all flows, but if flows could be reciprocal it probably wouldn&#39;t work out as well.\nUsing Other Non-map Representations of Flows\nOthers on this site have suggested using alternative diagrams to the actual map to represent the flows (just mapping the origins and destinations in some other manner than their actual geographic location). Examples of these are either cicular visualizations (such as that produced by Circos), arc diagrams (see this example on Protovis, these are also called kriskograms (Xiao &amp; Chun, 2009)), or matrix heat maps (here is another example from the Protovis website). Another option would be to use some type of automated network layout to identify patterns in the flows (such as that capable by Graphviz). Besides Graphviz it appears Gephi, the NetworkX python library, and some R libraries are popular tools as well (see this answer on the stats site).\nThe libraries I cite are pretty cool as they have developed interactive visualizations as well. Here is an example with a similar style to the circular graphics (although not circular!). Here is another interactive visualization using some of the line distortion techniques discussed earlier, network placement (that appears similar to circular Dorling cartograms) as well as other useful statistical summaries (I saw both of those examples originally on the information aesthetics blog).\n\nSome other resources I think are useful are the software and articles coming from the Spatial Data Mining and Visual Analytics Lab. Also the crime travel demand modeling in the CrimeStat program is a gentle introduction to applicable regression techniques for such flow data. Either of these tools may allow you to identify interesting correlations in the flow patterns to other geographic information. Another place to perhaps recieve some useful inspiration for either graphically displaying the data or statistical analysis would be a recent issue of in the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, Volume 20 Issue 2, on examining flight arrival/departure statistics for commercial carriers in the US from 1987 to 2008 (if you are interested in handling big data this would be worthwhile to examine as well). All the articles are free and they have associated posters with each paper.\nIn the end, the data and the medium will dictate how well some of these techniques work in reducing the visual clutter that comes along with flow data. I hope this is a useful place though to find ideas on how to deal with this visualization problem though. If you further refine your question into what you want to accomplish, then others can give useful feedback into actual programmatic implementations (if something is not already available).\n\nCitations\n\nCorcoran, Jonathan, Prem Chhetri &amp; Robert Stimson.

I&#39;m re-asking this question (it was asked once or twice over a couple of years by other people) because I&#39;m really surprised not to easily find such a thing already (I looked hard). \n\nI have found Anita Graser&#39;s styles - which are good, but only style basic data like roads (and do so simply). I&#39;ve successfully followed the directions for getting OSM data to work with. I&#39;ve carried out some basic style editing successfully. I realise I could create my own styles for this purpose - but this seems like a very big job. I want a visually pleasing map taking into account most of the data available on OSM (i.e. not just streets, but tracks, paths, rivers, woods, lakes, buildings and so on). I&#39;d have thought that there would be other people out there already doing the same... It seems odd to have to re-invent the wheel when both OSM and QGIS are open source / open data projects. I feel like maybe I&#39;ve just missed the obvious repository of OSM qml files which resides out there on the internet somewhere if you know where to look.\n\nAdditional notes in response to query below...\n\nIdeally I&#39;m looking for a Mapnik style rendering of the OSM data, but any equivalent properly developed and complete style would be good.\n\nAt the moment the objective is to use this data to produce paper mapping, but simple use of the mapping as base data on which other geographic data can be displayed also requires a decent rendering. At work I use Ordnance Survey data completely styled to produce a full and very detailed UK map (the point being that I didn&#39;t have to design this styling, it came with the data). I realise that other tools exist for paper mapping, but the same issues tend to arise at one stage or another... I&#39;m more or less successful in making the tool work for me in really basic terms, but to get to something visually useful I end up back with me either needing to re-invent a complete rendering style from scratch (beyond my skill), or encountering such a complex set of requirements for database setups or whatever that the process crashes and burns before I get anywhere useful. With a few more years of GIS experience I&#39;ll maybe be a database, CartoCSS (or whatever else) wizz... but until then I&#39;m prevented from using the amazing resource that OSM provides by this one barrier.\n\nUpdate (July 2015): Please note that I&#39;m still looking for information on this, and given that I&#39;ve just been informed that the question has had 2500 views in the last year clearly others are too.\n",

            "body": "You are really comparing chalk and cheese. WMS serves up raster tiles of data that have been created by a WMS server. This data can originally be vector or raster data and will have been drawn with style, but by the time it gets to your client it is just a raster image. WFS on the other hand, serves up vector data.\n\nGood places to look are the OGC website which has the standards documents as well as overview documents for the various services. This would be a reference to put in your bibliography. MapServer and GeoServer have lots of documentation on the way each of them deals with WMS and WFS. And of course, there is Wikipedia which has short but generally accurate pages on both, but I suspect you would lose marks if you actually cited the site in your thesis. Best just use it to get an overview.\n\nWith something like these geospatial web services, it usually pays dividends if you actually install a server and play around with creating maps. There are plenty of tutorials out there, and there are lots of previous posts on stackexchange.\n\nMy undergrad thesis is on the use of web mapping for the archaeology industry, and I have a virtual machine (VBox running JeOS Ubuntu 10.10) that runs mapserver and tinyows that I can connect to like a &quot;real&quot; server, and test what I&#39;m writing about.\n",

            "body": "This summarizes my understanding of some of the basic ideas.  Because it is hard to find all of them clearly described and summarized in one place, I could be wrong or misleading about some of them: comments and corrections are welcome.\n\n&quot;Geoids&quot; are approximations to a surface of gravitational equipotential. \n\n\n  The geoid is a hypothetical Earth surface that represents the mean sea level in the absence of winds, currents, and most tides. The geoid is a useful reference surface. It defines the horizontal everywhere and gravity acts perpendicular to it. A carpenter\u2019s level aligns itself along the geoid and a carpenter\u2019s plumb bob points down the vertical or perpendicular to the geoid. Water will not flow in aqueducts if the pipes are perfectly aligned along the geoid. Surveyors use knowledge of the geoid and the horizontal when they lay out highways and boundaries.\n\n\n(NASA)\n\n\n\nTo get a sense of what is gained relative to a sphere or ellipsoid, note that\n\n\nThe difference in apparent elevations between a spherical model and a good ellipsoid is up to two dozen kilometers.  This translates to maximum positioning discrepancies of about 22 kilometers.  The relatively large amount of positioning discrepancy occurs because there is a systematic distortion of the sphere relative to the ellipsoid: it attains one extreme at the poles and another extreme at the Equator.\nThe difference in apparent elevations between a good ellipsoid and a geoid is typically less than 100 meters (about 0.1 kilometers).  This is not a systematic difference: it varies a lot across relatively short sections of the earth (on the order of hundreds of kilometers).  Consequently, the maximum horizontal positioning discrepancy resulting from any hypothetical geoid-based projection is likely on the order of meters or less (usually much less except perhaps over large, carefully chosen areas). \nHowever, the deflection of the geoid (which is the amount by which true gravitational vertical direction varies) reaches up to about an arc-second, which makes it unsuitable for any kind of very high-accuracy mapping based on measuring latitude in terms of a local upward-pointing angle.  An arc-second of deflection translates to almost 30 meters on the ground, and such deflections can vary from one extreme to the other over just a few hundred kilometers.\n\n\nIn return for squeezing out that last 0.5% of accuracy in describing how the geoid varies from the ellipsoid, you need hundreds to hundreds of thousands of parameters compared to two to describe an ellipsoid.  Yes, it is mathematically possible to define a projection based on a geoid instead of an ellipsoid.  [See &quot;Coordinate charts&quot; on pp 4-5 of this text, for instance.  The modern mathematical definition of smooth curved surfaces, like a geoid, is based on a set of projections.  The Implicit Function Theorem guarantees such projections exist for the geoid.]  Computation would be, to say the least, inefficient (although it could be sped up by interpolation in precomputed tables).  When necessary, the difference in vertical positioning can be computed after ellipsoid-based projection in terms of the geoid parameters or by interpolating in a precomputed grid of geoid values.\n\nA serious potential problem with basing map projections on a geoid as reference surface is that the geoid is constantly changing worldwide.  It will change with changes in sea level, for instance.  \n\nBecause nowadays much geopositioning is done in geocentric coordinates, rather than by means of gravitational-based triangulating devices (such as levels), use of a geoid is practically irrelevant: an ellipsoid--however well it might or not be related to gravity, sea level, or the actual shape of the earth--serves as a reasonably stable reference surface relative to which everything else can be located and mapped.  The geoid is then described relative to this reference.  Its description is used in mapping primarily to permit GPS satellites to improve their positioning accuracy.\n",

            "body": "I am trying to calculate distortion so I can distort overlaying text and forms to precisely match an image of an equirectangular projection.\n\nHow does one calculate the distortion at a given latitude on an equirectangular projection 1:45,000,000 (say, 2000 pixels wide x 1000 pixels high)?  \n\nI&#39;ve been trying to figure out this post and its links to no avail:\nHow to create an accurate Tissot Indicatrix?\n\nI am not a professional, just a very interested amateur. \n\n\n\nHere&#39;s the long story.\n\nI am visualizing/mapping data using the Processing programming language and would like to have the 2D mapped data (different sized fonts and circles) appear undistorted when wrapped to a 3D globe. The data is mapped using equirectangular x, y&#39;s and the maps I want to use as backdrops are all this projection, so I&#39;m assuming I want to &quot;match&quot; this distortion (e.g. by calculating distortion via latitude using Tissot equations?). Using the programming language I can precisely distort both the text and the circles. I think all I need are the equations to do it correctly.\n\nHere is the original 2D data map:\n\n\n\nWhen wrapped it looks distorted, like this:\n\n\n\nHow can I make my 2D image look undistorted when wrapped to the 3D sphere?\n\nFor reference, here&#39;s the same question asked differently on the Processing forum.\n\n\n\nI&#39;m not sure I want to reproject to an orthographic projection.  I want my 2D data map to wrap to a 3D sphere model that can be interacted with (i.e. spun).\n\nI am using a 3D modeling program (Cinema 4D) to wrap a sphere with a 2MB &quot;Blue Marble&quot; image (equirectangular projection) from NASA.\n\nWhen wrapped it appears undistorted from all hemispheres (not just one hemisphere, as an orthographic projection would be?), see: still from 3D model above.  (The modeling program is doing the orthographic projection for me as I rotate the object, I suppose.)  Therefore, I think that if I distort my 2D data map in a similar way it too will appear undistorted on the 3D sphere.  Here&#39;s a shot I took with an equation that approximates equirectangular distortion.  You&#39;ll notice the egg shaped ellipses from the 2D image look like a circle when wrapped to the 3D sphere.  Similarly, the Tissot ellipses also appear as circles on the 3D sphere.\n\n\n\n\nThis is why I was looking at the Tissot equations...to more precisely figure out the distortion of the equirectangular projection at different latitudes so I could distort my overlay accordingly.\n\nPerhaps I should use a GIS program.  I just downloaded Cartographica and will see if I can figure it out.  \n\nAny Mac software suggestions for someone new undertaking this task?\n",

            "body": "I maintain the GPSTest app on Google Play, which is open-source on Github.\n\nI&#39;m actively interested in adding Galileo support in the app, but to do this I need to know what IDs the Galileo satellites show up as in the Android platform.  And, this requires that there be some agreement between Galileo hardware manufacturers of those IDs - see Is there an industry-standard official mapping of Galileo satellites to global &quot;PRN\u201d/ID values?.\n\nI personally haven&#39;t seen any Android devices reporting Galileo satellites yet - as soon as I do, and I&#39;m able to find out the ID range agreed upon for Galileo, I&#39;ll add support to GPSTest.\n\nIf you have an Android device that supports Galileo and you&#39;re willing to help identify the range, please comment on this Github issue.\n\nEDIT Sept. 19, 2016\n\nFor Android 7.0 (N) and higher, Google has added a new API in Android that allows apps to explicitly determine the GNSS type of each satellite for the following GNSS constellation (from https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/GnssStatus.html).\n\nI&#39;ll work on adding this to GPSTest, and will update my answer when it&#39;s live.\n\nEDIT Oct. 6th, 2016\n\nI have a working build of GPSTest that I believe should support Galileo.  If you have and a device with Galileo support (i.e., hardware), please comment on the below pull request on Github - I&#39;d love to get feedback to know if it works!\n\nhttps://github.com/barbeau/gpstest/pull/59\n\nEDIT Oct. 26, 2016\n\nGPSTest v2.1.8 and up now supports Galileo!  Download on Google Play at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.gpstest.  Supports all devices with Android 7.0 (N) that have a Galileo-compatible chipset. Support for Galileo on Android 6.0.1 (M) and lower will depend on your device OEM.\n\nSo far users have confirmed that they are able to see Galileo satellites using GPSTest on the following devices:\n\n\nBQ Aquaris X5 Plus (See this post)\nHuawei Mate 9 (See this post)\nSamsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ (See this post and official specs which say &quot;Location (GPS, Galileo, Glonass, BeiDou) *Galileo and BeiDou coverage may be limited.&quot;)\nOnePlus 5 (Android 7.1.1 / OxygenOS 4.5.8) (See this post)\nHuawei P10 (See this post - Android 7.0, firmware version L29C432B171)\nOnePlus 5T (See this post)\n\n\nEDIT Mar. 26, 2018\n\nThe site UseGalileo.eu (by the EU GSA that operates Galileo) now has a list of devices and chipsets that support Galileo:\n\n\nGalileo-compatible smartphones and chipsets\n\n",

Every projection has strengths and weaknesses and will preserve some elements of direction, distance or area better or worse than others (which is why careful selection of a suitable, that is local where possible,  projection is so important).\nSo, while the unit of measurement in EPSG:3857 is indeed meters, as you have correctly spotted, distance measurements become increasingly inaccurate away from the equator. All Mercator-style projections have the same limitation as they move away from their reference point. But, where they are not global, the error can be minimized by appropriate positioning of this point.  It is for this reason there are so many UTM zones for instance.  Other projections have different strengths and weaknesses depending on use (e.g. navigation vs cartography).\nSo what&#39;s the point of EPSG:3857?  To understand that, you must understand that it was designed for web mapping and is square so that the map tiles fit nicely into a powers-of-two schema as you progress through each successive zoom-level.  This is EPSG:3857&#39;s particular strength.  It is not designed for distance and area calculations.  There are many much better alternatives.  If you are not using the data for web mapping, I would strongly encourage you to consider some other projection that is more suitable to your use-case, especially if you intend to do distance calculations (or, in that event, cast your data in geographic coordinates and not Cartesian coordinates and use the Haversine formula to calculate distances on a sphere).\nEDIT (re comments):\nThe diagram added to the OP&#39;s question basically is a diagram of my first paragraph, viz that the project introduces distortion.  For more information on how the Earth is projected in this case see here.  The unit of measurement for Web Mercator is NOT pixels but meters.  The OP&#39;s question results from a misunderstanding.   Vector data can also be projected in Web Mercator.  In this case there are no pixels.  So you see, the concept of a unit of measurement as pixels has no relationship to the real world.  However, pixels-per-meter is relevant for a raster as this tells us the resolution of the image.  BUT the unit of measurement is still meters (in this case) and not pixels.\nWhere the confusion for the OP possibly arises is the use of Web Mercator at various zoom levels where tiles are usually set to be 256x256 pixels and a given zoom level has a certain nominal ground resolution, so some web mapping applications use screen pixels as a means of calculating distance.  But, the pixels are interpreted as a meters-distance in relation to the zoom level (and possibly latitude).\n",

For example, if you imagine that you start a business making GPS Maps for Bikes, or some such, down the road, getting the data that you give to Google back out for use in the product you want to sell may be difficult, or simply a violation of the Terms of Service which you would not be allowed to pursue.\n\nOpenStreetMap is openly licensed dataset. It is created and supported by more than 500,000 editors, and the data is available for libre (that is, &#39;free as in freedom&#39;) use under the terms of the ODBL, which would allow you to make the GPS Maps For Bikes app without needing to pay a licensing fee to anyone.\n\nData you add to Google Maps is collectively licensed to Google. (Your individual contributions presumably have relatively limited value outside the collection of data, as is the case in almost any map-making effort.)  If you do something Google doesn&#39;t want, then they can say No, and shut you down. Innovation by third parties outside the scope of what limitations Google provides for is not allowed.\n\nOpenStreetMap data is openly licensed and managed by a non-profit organization dedicated to furthering the use of geographic information around the world. If no one has done the new cool thing that you want to do -- you can get the data, and do it. \n\nShort term, you may get more out of Google -- with a massive corporate investment in user-targeted tools, and a massive investment in initial data -- but over time, OpenStreetMap&#39;s openly licensed data is likely to be the more sustainable solution.

It&#39;s been my experience that these autogenerated APIs get pretty nasty when passing non-native C++ types (int, floats) and are never very &#39;pythonic&#39;.\nMy recommended solution would be to use the ctypes API. A great tutorial is here: http://python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/tutorial.html\nThe basic steps are:\n\nwrite some of your core logic in C++, the ones where you believe python performance might be an issue\nCompile that core logic (in this case using the ArcObject C++ API method calls) from object files into a shared (.so) or dynamic library (.dll) using whatever system compiler (nmake,make, etc.)\nWrite a ctypes mapping between the python class and the C++ method signature [SWIG tries to automate this, but it&#39;s easy, even if using crazy object types]\nImport the compiled library into your python program and use the bound class/method bindings like any other python class!\n\nThis is probably more general way to reference C/C++ code from within python, it is probably going to be much simpler in the long run if you don&#39;t have to deal with COM objects. It also will allow all of the system specific functionality reside in the compilation of the linked library object (so the python will not be system/python implementation specific).\n",

The best information about calculating topographic curvature probably comes from Hurst et al 2012 and the references therein.\nThe basic principle of curvature calculation, as with slope and aspect, is to pass a moving window over the elevation surface and fit the elevation values to a 6 term polynomial function, the coefficients of which will yield the slope, aspect and curvature of the centre cell of the moving window.\nArcGIS uses a 3x3 search window which will only yield good results in areas completely devoid of vegetation, which makes the tool fairly useless unless people are aware of this limitation, this may suggest why it is not present in QGIS.\nThe maths was derived originally (I think) in Evans (1980) and was simplified in a few pages in Principles of Geographical Information Systems (Amazon link) which I can recommend as a good guide to this kind of terrain analysis at a basic level.\nOne way to calculate curvature of a DEM is to convert the DEM into an ascii raster, read it into a numpy array and then perform the polynomial fitting on a moving window passing through the data. This is fairly easy to do, but is very slow to execute and needs a fair amount of optimization (these kind of operations often get ported to c++ to speed them up).\nTo perform the operation in QGIS you can use the GRASS plugin r.slope.aspect which is also limited by the 3x3 fixed window.\nI realize this is not the simple answer you were doubtless hoping for, but I hope you understand that curvature is complex to derive in a meaningful way.

            "body": "I&#39;ve figured out an algorithm for the grid approach using several Python tools. Rasterising and polygonising is done with rasterio, which is based on GDAL/OGR.  Here are most of the imports:\n\n\n\nFirst, get a few polygon shapes to do statistics with. The list of shape must be sort-of overlapping, otherwise this procedure won&#39;t work as well. There are many way to get these shape into Python, e.g., read a Shapefile with fiona.\n\n\n\nOr how about these five polygons:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to grid the vectors, some appropriate raster resolutions need to be determined, and applied to the data extents. E.g., I&#39;m doing everything on a 1 metre grid, but it can be modified to any number. Then build an affine geotransform from the upper-left corner.\n\n\n\nLoop through each polygon, and rasterise them to a grid, where each will be 0 outside the polygon and 1 inside. With each result, accumulate a values to the array , which we&#39;ll normalise to values 0.0 (zero coverage) to 1.0 (all covered). This raster is basically the probability that a polygon covers the grid.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next step is really only needed if you want a smoothish result from only a few overlapping polygons. It will blur the sharp edges of probability array. You will need a modified  function with full convolution to avoid edge distortions, which modifies the geotransform size.\n\n\n\nNow use the function to do a Gaussian blur on a radius of 100 grid cells (or 100 m in this example), and return the larger-sized array and geotransform results:\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the &quot;average&quot; result can be extracted by selecting a quantile threshold. So, using 0.1 will select a larger area that 10% or more of the polygons cover, while 0.95 will choose a smaller area with 95% coverage. Using 0.5 is the median quantile threshold close to what could be called &quot;average&quot;. Because this example has an odd-number of shapes we get a nice result, but with even-numbers of samples the result is really sensitive.\n\n\n\n\n\nConvert the grid result back to vector, and simplify-away the jagged pixel shapes using a minimum distance of a grid diagonal (or more).\n\n\n\n\n",
