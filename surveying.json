            "body": "Accuracy is the tendency of your measurements to agree with the true values.  Precision is the degree to which your measurements pin down an actual value.  The question is about an interplay of accuracy and precision.\nAs a general principle, you don&#39;t need much more precision in recording your measurements than there is accuracy built into them.  Using too much precision can mislead people into believing the accuracy is greater than it really is.\nGenerally, when you degrade precision--that is, use fewer decimal places--you can lose some accuracy.  But how much?  It&#39;s good to know that the meter was originally defined (by the French, around the time of their revolution when they were throwing out the old systems and zealously replacing them by new ones) so that ten million of them would take you from the equator to a pole.  That&#39;s 90 degrees, so one degree of latitude covers about 10^7/90 = 111,111 meters.  (&quot;About,&quot; because the meter&#39;s length has changed a little bit in the meantime.  But that doesn&#39;t matter.)  Furthermore, a degree of longitude (east-west) is about the same or less in length than a degree of latitude, because the circles of latitude shrink down to the earth&#39;s axis as we move from the equator towards either pole.  Therefore, it&#39;s always safe to figure that the sixth decimal place in one decimal degree has 111,111/10^6 = about 1/9 meter = about 4 inches of precision.\nAccordingly, if your accuracy needs are, say, give or take 10 meters, than 1/9 meter is nothing: you lose essentially no accuracy by using six decimal places.  If your accuracy need is sub-centimeter, then you need at least seven and probably eight decimal places, but more will do you little good.\nThirteen decimal places will pin down the location to 111,111/10^13 = about 1 angstrom, around half the thickness of a small atom.\nUsing these ideas we can construct a table of what each digit in a decimal degree signifies:\n\nThe sign tells us whether we are north or south, east or west on the globe.\nA nonzero hundreds digit tells us we&#39;re using longitude, not latitude!\nThe tens digit gives a position to about 1,000 kilometers.  It gives us useful information about what continent or ocean we are on.\nThe units digit (one decimal degree) gives a position up to 111 kilometers (60 nautical miles, about 69 miles).  It can tell us roughly what large state or country we are in.\nThe first decimal place is worth up to 11.1 km: it can distinguish the position of one large city from a neighboring large city.\nThe second decimal place is worth up to 1.1 km: it can separate one village from the next.\nThe third decimal place is worth up to 110 m: it can identify a large agricultural field or institutional campus.\nThe fourth decimal place is worth up to 11 m: it can identify a parcel of land.  It is comparable to the typical accuracy of an uncorrected GPS unit with no interference.\nThe fifth decimal place is worth up to 1.1 m: it distinguish trees from each other.  Accuracy to this level with commercial GPS units can only be achieved with differential correction.\nThe sixth decimal place is worth up to 11 cm: you can use this for laying out structures in detail, for designing landscapes, building roads.  It should be more than good enough for tracking movements of glaciers and rivers.  This can be achieved by taking painstaking measures with GPS, such as differentially corrected GPS.\nThe seventh decimal place is worth up to 1.1 cm: this is good for much surveying and is near the limit of what GPS-based techniques can achieve.\nThe eighth decimal place is worth up to 1.1 mm: this is good for charting motions of tectonic plates and movements of volcanoes.  Permanent, corrected, constantly-running GPS base stations might be able to achieve this level of accuracy.\nThe ninth decimal place is worth up to 110 microns: we are getting into the range of microscopy.  For almost any conceivable application with earth positions, this is overkill and will be more precise than the accuracy of any surveying device.\nTen or more decimal places indicates a computer or calculator was used and that no attention was paid to the fact that the extra decimals are useless.  Be careful, because unless you are the one reading these numbers off the device, this can indicate low quality processing!\n\n",

            "body": "I make my living applying mathematics and statistics to solving the kinds of problems a GIS is designed to address.  One can learn to use a GIS effectively without knowing much math at all: millions of people have done it.  But over the years I have read (and responded to) many thousands of questions about GIS and in many of these situations some basic mathematical knowledge, beyond what&#39;s usually taught (and remembered) in high school, would have been a distinct advantage.\n\nThe material that keeps coming up includes the following:\n\n\nTrigonometry and spherical trigonometry.  Let me surprise you: this stuff is overused.  In many cases trig can be avoided altogether by using simpler, but slightly more advanced, techniques, especially basic vector arithmetic.\nElementary differential geometry.  This is the investigation of smooth curves and surfaces.  It was invented by C. F. Gauss in the early 1800&#39;s specifically to support wide-area land surveys, so its applicability to GIS is obvious.  Studying the basics of this field prepares the mind well to understand geodesy, curvature, topographic shapes, and so on.\nTopology.  No, this does not mean what you think it means: the word is consistently abused in GIS.  This field emerged in the early 1900&#39;s as a way to unify otherwise difficult concepts with which people had been grappling for centuries.  These include concepts of infinity, of space, of nearness, of connectedness.  Among the accomplishments of 20th century topology was the ability to describe spaces and calculate with them.  These techniques have trickled down into GIS in the form of vector representations of lines, curves, and polygons, but that merely scratches the surface of what can be done and of the beautiful ideas lurking there.  (For an accessible account of part of this history, read Imre Lakatos&#39; Proofs and Refutations.  This book is a series of dialogs within a hypothetical classroom that is pondering questions that we would recognize as characterizing the elements of a 3D GIS.  It requires no math beyond grade school but eventually introduces the reader to homology theory.)\n\nDifferential geometry and topology also deal with &quot;fields&quot; of geometric objects, including the vector and tensor fields Waldo Tobler has been talking about for the latter part of his career.  These describe extensive phenomena within space, such as temperatures, winds, and crustal movements.\nCalculus. Many people in GIS are asked to optimize something: find the best route, find the best corridor, the best view, the best configuration of service areas, etc.  Calculus underlies all thinking about optimizing functions that depend smoothly on their parameters.  It also offers ways to think about and calculate lengths, areas, and volumes.  You don&#39;t need to know much Calculus, but a little will go a long way.\nNumerical analysis. We often have difficulties solving problems with the computer because we run into limits of precision and accuracy.  This can cause our procedures to take a long time to execute (or be impossible to run) and can result in wrong answers.  It helps to know the basic principles of this field so that you can understand where the pitfalls are and work around them.\nComputer science. Specifically, some discrete mathematics and methods of optimization contained therein.  This includes some basic graph theory, design of data structures, algorithms, and recursion, as well as a study of complexity theory.\nGeometry. Of course.  But not Euclidean geometry: a tiny bit of spherical geometry, naturally; but more important is the modern view (dating to Felix Klein in the late 1800&#39;s) of geometry as the study of groups of transformations of objects.  This is the unifying concept to moving objects around on the earth or on the map, to congruence, to similarity.\nStatistics. Not all GIS professionals need to know statistics, but it is becoming clear that a basic statistical way of thinking is essential.  All our data are ultimately derived from measurements and heavily processed afterwards.  The measurements and the processing introduce errors that can only be treated as random.  We need to understand randomness, how to model it, how to control it when possible, and how to measure it and respond to it in any case.  That does not mean studying t-tests, F-tests, etc; it means studying the foundations of statistics so that we can become effective problem solvers and decision makers in the face of chance.  It also means learning some modern ideas of statistics, including exploratory data analysis and robust estimation as well as principles of constructing statistical models.\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that I am not advocating that all GIS practitioners need to learn all this stuff!  Also, I am not suggesting that the different topics should be learned in isolation by taking separate courses.  This is merely an (incomplete) compendium of some of the most powerful and beautiful ideas that many GIS people would deeply appreciate (and be able to apply) were they to know them.  What I suspect we need is to learn enough about these subjects to know when they might be applicable, to know where to go for help, and to know how to learn more if it should be needed for a project or a job.  From that perspective, taking a lot of courses would be overkill and would likely tax the patience of the most dedicated student.  But for anyone who has an opportunity to learn some mathematics and has a choice of what to learn and how to learn it, this list might provide some guidance.\n",

The problem is that accurate map material is neither allowed to be published, nor to leave the country. The Chinese National Bureau of Surveying and Mapping require all companies to obtain permits for map surveying and published map data must be obfuscated, resulting in a deviation of up to 700m between the map and the real world. Sounds strange, but that is how it is.\n\nYou can easily see the result of this obfuscation if you e.g. in Google Maps look at the satellite imagery with a map overlay. It is especially obvious in border proximity, where you will see that the map data for China is skewed, while the map outside China is correct. If you look at this area, the Shenzhen Bay with the border between China and Hong Kong, you can see that the map over Hong Kong in the lower right area is correct, while in the middle of the bay, the map seem to indicate that the bridge makes a sharp bend to the right, while you on the satellite image can see that the bridge in reality is straight. In the upper left area (mainland China), you can then see that there is a significant discrepancy between the imagery and the map. Roads seem to float on the water, pass through buildings and what else not.\n\nSome additional information based on questions in the comments:\n\nThe Chinese Surveying and Mapping Law does not explain why the restriction is in place. It is commonly quoted that it is for national security purposes, but I am not really sure if there is any official statement on that subject at all. Similar regulations and restrictions are actually quite common in many other countries as well, but usually do not apply to the entire country, just to &#39;places of interest&#39;.\n\nThe obfuscation algorithm is prespecified, not publicly known, but is obviously deterministic. Since a lot of example data is available, there have been attempts to reverse-engineer the algorithm and there are more or less reliable software libraries available allowing a backwards mapping from obfuscated to real coordinates. There is more information and links to further resources on the Wikipedia page &#39;Restrictions on geographic data in China&#39;.\n",

Otherwise it is excellent and\nthe devs are working on python compatibility meaning you will be able\nto use google and bing maps as well as open streets etc.\nThe main issues are that the gui is designed for  a standard screen\nand all the buttons and icons are tiny on anything smaller than a 10&quot;\nscreen.\nFor basic navigation and data entry on a custom map, i was using\navenzas&#39; pdf maps on iOs, which imports geo-registered PDFs. They have\na beta for android which I haven&#39;t used but am planning on trialling.\nyou can make geo-registered pdfs in mapinfo or arcmap.\n\n\nSo far I have settled on collecting KML based vector data with limited attribution.\nApps I have used:\n\nLocus (free and paid version) https://market.android.com/details?id=menion.android.locus&amp;feature=related_apps\nOruxMaps https://market.android.com/details?id=com.orux.oruxmaps\nGoogle Tracks (pre-installed on my phone)\n\nLocus and Orux allow connecting to WMS services, Google/Bing, etc... I believe there is a separate add-on to allow Google maps in Locus.\n\nI came across this interesting application that looks (have not used it) interesting for collection of data.\nhttp://code.google.com/p/geopaparazzi/\nSome more info:\nGeopaparazzi is a tool developed to do very fast qualitative engineering/geologic surveys. Even if the main aim is in the field of surveying, it contains tools that can be of great use also to OpenStreetMappers as well as tourists that want to keep a geo-diary. Geopaparazzi is available on the Android Market.\nTo get started jump into the documentation section: https://code.google.com/p/geopaparazzi/wiki/Docs\nThe main aim of Geopaparazzi is to have a tool that:\n\nfits in any pocket and can be always at hand, when needed\ngives the possibility to take georeferenced and possibly orientated pictures during the survey, with further possibility to import them into the main GIS application BeeGIS\nis able to exploit easily internet connection, if available.\nis extremely easy to use and intuitive, providing just few important functionalities.\n\nThe main features available in Geopaparazzi are:\n\ngeoreferenced notes\ngeoreferenced and orientated pictures\ngps tracks logging\neasy export of collected data\na map view for the navigation of the environment\n\nThis recent presentation might give more insight: http://www.slideshare.net/moovida/geopaparazzi-state-of-the-art\n\nWe develop a mobile GIS solution for Android tablets called Mappt, which has a free trial available from the Google Play store.  The trial version allows you access to all functionality of the software, with the exception that you can not export your data.\nYou can grab the trial for free from the Google Play Store:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.mappt\nWith Mappt, you can:\n\nCapture and work with your vector data offline.\nImport and export in Shapefile and KML formats.\nWork with WGS84 and UTM-based Coordinate Reference Systems.\nImport directly from Google Drive and export to email.\nImport your own large imagery, fully available offline, via the ArcGIS Compact Cache Bundle format.  We are also actively implementing other options to import imagery.\nRecord GPS paths.\nDefine geofences, with audible and visual alerts.\n\nSee the Mappt website for further information: www.mappt.com.au\n\n\n\nFulcrum is a cost-effective and customizable GIS mobile data collection platform. Includes a 30-day trial at sign up!\nhttp://fulcrumapp.com/\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spatialnetworks.fulcrum&amp;hl=en\n\n\nI&#39;m working on this and I have just published a GIS application: ItacaMap for Android ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.itacasoft.itacamap ). At the moment you can see basic functionality (zoom, pan, view info, browse, select by rectangle, etc.), but I have already implemented edit functionalities (at least on the server side) and more is cooking.\n\nGeospago is a new application.  It is a software-as-a-solution (SaaS) because it has a mobile application working in conjunction with a web application.  Both may be used for collecting/inputting data, editing/updating data, viewing/sharing data, and importing/exporting data.  The web portal runs on amazon with geoserver and syncs with the android app, which uses SQLite.\nThe web portal is used to invite/manage users, control user access to projects, create projects and custom forms, deploy the forms to users, and manage data.  It can import SHP &amp; CSV files for data maintenance workflows.  It can export data to the standard formats (CSV, KML, SHP), but aslo provides feeds and an API.  This allows users to add a WFS feed to ArcMap or QGIS to see the data live from the cloud, a network link to Google Earth, or create your own script to pull the data through API requests to integrate with other systems.  Collecting data is easy as well as quickly getting new or updated data back into a enterprise system of record.  Geospago is the only app I have seen so far that provides this.\nThe mobile app is used to collect, view, and edit data (point, line, and polygon).  It runs on both phones and tablets.  It handles connected and disconnected environments through the use of mbtiles.  It allows multiple photos to be attached to a single record.  It also has barcode scanning and signature capabilities.  Synchronization is set to user specified intervals or can be manually forced.  This prevents overlap and duplication if you have multiple people collecting data for the same projects in connected areas.\nGeospago is very affordable and available on a monthly, per-license pricing model that it can be frozen between projects or cancel-at-any-time basis so you can use it only when you need it.  Data is secure on Amazon cloud and can be download it at any time.\nThe Geospago website has more information and has a sign up link.  The website also has a link to the mobile app on the Google Play Store.\n\nFound an app called MapItFast that is easy to use.  A free version that lets you gather point, line, polygon features and even photos.  I&#39;ve used it for its basemaps and to calculate distance and area.  Unfortunately, the data stays on the device (no way to export or share..that I can find) without upgrading to the cloud services.  But that looks interesting since data can be exported to CSV, GPX, SHP and KMZ, it has built in synchronization to collaborate on mapping and location, full attribution, editing, and probably a bunch of other stuff I don&#39;t know about yet.  Might be useful to those folks doing group mapping on an Android and wanting a way to get it into Google Maps or ArcGIS.  I like the idea of a low cost Internet Map Server and tools.\nTheir website (http://www.mapitfast.com) has YouTube video.  I downloaded from Google Play.  Found the brochure online:\nhttp://www.mapitfast.com/Documents/MIF_Brochure_2013.pdf\n",

What you should (not) do to solve the problem\nDo NOT &quot;change&quot; the CRS. When you , you simply assigning another CRS definition to your layer. You should never do that if you&#39;re not 100% sure about what you do.\nThis option is only for the case if the layer&#39;s CRS is somehow not correctly recognized - then you have to manually tell QGIS which CRS the layer was initially created in. You have to know the exact CRS, the definition the coordinates of the features are saved in.\nEach layer is saved with coordinates in a certain CRS (projection). So if you assign another CRS, the coordinates from one CRS (like EPSG:4326 / WGS84) are interpreted as being coordinate values belonging to another CRS, in your case NAD83/ New York Long Island EPSG:32118.\nTo make a comparison: it&#39;s somehow like if you had a length measurement in inches and you simply &quot;change&quot; it to meters by replacing &quot;inches&quot; with &quot;meters&quot;, but leaving the numbers as they are: .  This is what you did, simply &quot;assigning&quot; another CRS (=another definition how to interpret the numbers). This can&#39;t work - you must convert (1 inch = 0.0254 m): .\nWhat you should do is reprojecting the layer: right click on your layer /  or go to menu . There, you can define the CRS that your existing layer should be reprojected to. You will get a copy of your input layer in the new CRS.\nWhen saving, in the dialog window you have a CRS section with a drop down menu where you can select the CRS you want to reproject to. Or click on the right side the small symbol &quot;globe with grid&quot;. It will open an advanced CRS selection dialog with more information and the option to filter the CRS description by introducing some letters or numbers:\n\n\n2. Case study to illustrate assigning CRS vs. reprojection\nTo illustrate that: let&#39;s say you have coordinates in  (WGS84, GPS coordinates) 0&#176; E, 51.4777&#176; N: a point nearby the Greenwich observatory in London (today&#39;s IERS reference meridian passes a few dozen meters to the east of the observatory, but that is another story, however it shows how complex the topic is).\nIf you now change the EPSG, you assign another definition to the coordinate values of 0 and 51.4777. Let&#39;s say we tell QGIS that these values are in Web Mercator, . This defintion has it&#39;s point of origin at the intersection of the equator (red line) with the prime meridian (blue line), a point in the Atlantic west ob Gabon, south of Ghana: the red cross on the following map:\n\nThis point of origin is the same as when using . But  is a projected CRS, thus it measures it&#39;s coordinates not on a globe (spheroid) as  does that uses degrees as unit, but on a planar map projection and uses meters. Both start at the same point of origin in the Atlantic. So in /WebMercator, the latitude is measured in meters and our point will be 51.4777 meters to the north of this point, thus in the Atlantic very close to the point of origin. The longitude still has the &quot;right&quot; value because 0 remains zero, thus in this special case, nothing changes (to make things a bit easier here).\nYou see this on this screenshot: a point created in  with coordinates lon 0, lat 51.4777 creates a point that is a few dozen meters north of the equator (red line):\n\nTo get the &quot;right&quot; coordinates value for the point near the Greenwich observatory in , we must use a transformaton algorithm. QGIS normally handels this automatically when we reproject. But often there are several different algorithms for the transformation available. In such cases, QGIS alerts with a dialog window where we can choose one of the available transformations - see the following screenshot. The background: this has to do with different mathematical methods of transformation. Calculating the earths shape to different projections is not so trivial and is almost always not 100% exact, so you always get minor errors when reprojecting - see the info about the accuracy in the screenshot:\n\nWhen we reproject, we see that the latitude for our point near Greenwich observatory is 6706107.21 in  - that means: 6706.1 km to the north of the point of origin in the Atlantic. Be aware: this value is not a distance on earth&#39;s surface, but on the projected planar map canvas. Web Mercator heavily distorts lengths, so the values in meters are of use for coordinate values only, not for measuring distances.\nWe could now use another projected CRS, let&#39;s say ,  Ordnance Survey, British National Grid. After transformation, we see that the same point near Greenwich observatory has again other coordinates: lat: 177234.2, lon: 538989.7. These values are again in meters, but are completely different from the meters we had before when using Web Mercator. So you see: the values only make sense if they are interpreted in the correct CRS.\n\n3. An analogy that should help to make this difference better understandable\nAn analogy of the difference between set CRS and reproject, as this is a very common mistake a lot of users make: To better understand, you could imagine the different CRS as different &quot;languages&quot; (conventions about the meaning of symbols). If you have a text and try to translate it, you must first know in which language your text is to be able to look for the right dictionaries, hire the right interpreter or do the correct setting in the automatic translation tool.\nWhen you have a text in English and want to have a translation into Chinese, you can&#39;t just stick the label &quot;Chinese&quot; on the first page: this does not translate it. To the contrary, the text will make no sense: a native speaker of Chinese will still not be able to understand it (without knowing English) as the English words have no meaning in Chinese. Maybe some words happen to sound similar in both languages, but with completely different meaning: that&#39;s what happened to you: your layer was shown in QGIS, but in a wrong, meaningless place.\nSo that should help understand why you can&#39;t simply &quot;change&quot; the language. You must translate - the analogy of reprojecting in QGIS: every word/sentence must be taken from one language to the other one, according to certain rules (grammar). The same with reprojecting: every coordinate has to be recalculated respecting some transformation algorithms.\nIf you use an online translation tool as Google translate, the language of many texts you paste is automatically recognized. This is what QGIS also tries: when you load data, you normally should not have to set manually the CRS, as in almost all cases the CRS should be already stored in your data. So only if the CRS is not correctly recognized, you should manually assign the correct CRS.\n\n4. Using batch process to transform several layers at once in QGIS\nIf you have several files or layers, you run this as batch process. Just start the reproject dialog using the menu (as described above), than you find a button at the bottom left to start the tool as batch process, see:\n\n",

I&#39;m re-asking this question (it was asked once or twice over a couple of years by other people) because I&#39;m really surprised not to easily find such a thing already (I looked hard). \n\nI have found Anita Graser&#39;s styles - which are good, but only style basic data like roads (and do so simply). I&#39;ve successfully followed the directions for getting OSM data to work with. I&#39;ve carried out some basic style editing successfully. I realise I could create my own styles for this purpose - but this seems like a very big job. I want a visually pleasing map taking into account most of the data available on OSM (i.e. not just streets, but tracks, paths, rivers, woods, lakes, buildings and so on). I&#39;d have thought that there would be other people out there already doing the same... It seems odd to have to re-invent the wheel when both OSM and QGIS are open source / open data projects. I feel like maybe I&#39;ve just missed the obvious repository of OSM qml files which resides out there on the internet somewhere if you know where to look.\n\nAdditional notes in response to query below...\n\nIdeally I&#39;m looking for a Mapnik style rendering of the OSM data, but any equivalent properly developed and complete style would be good.\n\nAt the moment the objective is to use this data to produce paper mapping, but simple use of the mapping as base data on which other geographic data can be displayed also requires a decent rendering. At work I use Ordnance Survey data completely styled to produce a full and very detailed UK map (the point being that I didn&#39;t have to design this styling, it came with the data). I realise that other tools exist for paper mapping, but the same issues tend to arise at one stage or another... I&#39;m more or less successful in making the tool work for me in really basic terms, but to get to something visually useful I end up back with me either needing to re-invent a complete rendering style from scratch (beyond my skill), or encountering such a complex set of requirements for database setups or whatever that the process crashes and burns before I get anywhere useful. With a few more years of GIS experience I&#39;ll maybe be a database, CartoCSS (or whatever else) wizz... but until then I&#39;m prevented from using the amazing resource that OSM provides by this one barrier.\n\nUpdate (July 2015): Please note that I&#39;m still looking for information on this, and given that I&#39;ve just been informed that the question has had 2500 views in the last year clearly others are too.\n",

(I won&#39;t reproduce them here because this site doesn&#39;t have appropriate tools for communicating mathematical formulas.)  They require all four first derivatives of the projected coordinates (x,y) with respect to the spherical coordinates (lat, lon) = (phi, lambda):\n\n\n\nEverything else about the TI&#39;s is computed in terms of these (using some arithmetic and trigonometric functions: the cosine, principal inverse sine, and principal inverse tangent).  The computations require a description of the earth&#39;s shape.  For the greatest accuracy use an ellipsoidal datum with semimajor axis a and eccentricity e.  (These will be known to the software.)\n\nSnyder&#39;s book has instructions on how to compute everything except these derivatives.  Do it numerically.  I have had excellent results using first-order central finite difference estimates at a distance of h = 10^(-5.2) radians (typically around 50 meters): this is a good compromise between trying to get infinitesimally close and losing too much precision from floating point roundoff (assuming double precision), because the error made is proportional to (10^(-5.2))^2 = 10^(-10.4) and 10^(-5.2) equals 10^10.4 times the IEEE double precision accuracy of 10^(-15.6) and it&#39;s still a lot larger than typical precision in projections, which usually run from 10^(-10) to about 10^(-14).\n\nSo, how do you compute finite difference estimates?  This part is surprisingly easy.   To obtain dx/d(phi) at a point (phi, lambda), ask your GIS to project the points\n\n\n\nUse the estimates\n\n\n\nSimilarly, project the points\n\n\n\nand use the estimates\n\n\n\nThat takes four projections and a tiny bit of arithmetic.  (You can reduce it to three by using non-central differences, but the accuracy goes down a little.  It&#39;s wise aim for high accuracy, without letting h get too small, unless you are sure your GIS is using survey-grade (millimeter) accuracy in its projection formulas.)\n\nFrom these derivatives, along with Snyder&#39;s formulas (paying attention to the modifications described at 4-19 and 4-21), you can obtain the lengths of the axes of the Tissot Indicatrix at (phi, lambda) and its orientation.  On world-scale maps the TI will be so small as to be invisible, so the final thing to do is decide how much you want to rescale each TI.  I determine the scale factor by finding out how large the map will be, finding the sizes of typical TIs across the map, and scaling so that those TIs will be approximately 6% as wide as the map.  It&#39;s a good start, anyway; I let the user adjust the size of the TI from there.  Of course you will rescale all the TIs by the same amount, so they can be compared, and each will be rescaled around its own center (which is obtained by a fifth projection, (phi, lambda) --&gt; (x,y)).\n\nA nice addition to the elliptical portrayal of the TI is to show the directions of the local meridian and parallel: then, at a glance, you can assess the grid convergence.  I also show a standard circle (representing no distortion) concentric with each TI because it improves the reader&#39;s ability to gauge the amount of distortion represented by each ellipse.\n\n\n\nOf note in this Mollweide projection is the extreme TI near the south pole.  It is still a perfect ellipse and accurately describes the map distortion there.\n",

            "body": "No, there is no absolute value for RMS, because it depends on the quality of the map being georeferenced, the quality of the target (base) map, and the purpose of the georeferencing.  In particular, any advice that relates RMS to cellsize is misinformed, because cellsize reflects precision in the digital representation of an image whereas the RMS error reflects average accuracy (assuming the basemap is perfectly accurate).  Although distinguishing precision and accuracy may seem like aimless pedantry, confusing them is a basic mistake with practical consequences.\n\nAll this is rather vague, so let&#39;s look at a specific example.  Recently I received a series of screenshots of maps showing soil sample locations.  To obtain coordinates, I planned to georeference these screenshots to an orthophoto base map and then digitize the points with heads-up digitization.  Among the considerations were:\n\n\nThe orthophoto base map has 0.3 m cellsize.\nThe screenshots have approximately 2 m cellsize.\nThe soil sample locations were not surveyed; they were located &quot;by eye&quot; on the map when the sampler was in the field.  The client estimated the accuracy was about 3 m, but 10 m is more likely.\nThe screenshots have few sharp details: they are primarily contour lines, with occasional fencelines (which are not clearly visible in the orthophoto).  Thus establishing many good links would be time-consuming and error-prone.\nThere was likely some local distortion in the screenshots, meaning that high accuracy (low RMS) can be achieved only with complex transformations.\nIt was important to digitize the soil sample locations so that relative distances were fairly accurate for nearby points, but absolute accuracy was unnecessary, because one outcome of the study will be to obtain many more soil samples that refine and make more precise this preliminary survey.\n\n\nTo obtain an RMS of half the larger cellsize would require a high-order polynomial transformation or warping across a grid of points, calling for establishing a network of around 50 - 100 good links between the images: one to several hours of careful work, most likely, given the difficulty of even finding visible links.  To obtain an RMS of half the smaller cellsize would require an order of magnitude more effort: days of work.  However, for the purposes of the study an RMS of 5 m would be more than sufficient.  This was achieved with 7 links and an affine transformation, just a few minutes&#39; work.  Note that this RMS is several times greater than the larger of the two cellsizes in the images.\n\nThis example illustrates how blindly following bad rules of thumb can be costly.  Pay attention first to your data quality objectives; everything else follows from them.\n",

You might want to think twice about removing these polygons if you need the affected postal codes for your analysis.\n\n\n\nThat said, here&#39;s how you can remove these polygons:\n\n\nSelect all vertical street polygons by clicking &quot;Select Features Using an Expression&quot;  and entering . This will select all features that have a postal code starting with , which are the vertical streets.\n\n\nSimply deleting the features won&#39;t help, since the polygons will leave holes behind, as you have already noticed. Instead, you can merge the vertical streets with a neighbouring large polygon using &quot;Vector / Geoprocessing tools / Eliminate sliver polygons&quot;, saving the result to a new file.\n\n\nYou may get the warning message that some features could not be dissolved, together with a list of feature ID&#39;s. If you also want to get rid of these features, select the vertical streets in the new layer using the expression from before, and then do one of the following:\n\n\nIf you want an automatic solution, you can dissolve the vertical streets togehter with all neighbouring polygons. Save the selection to a new layer using &quot;Layer / Save selection as vector file&quot;, and then use &quot;Vector / Research Tools / Select by location&quot; to select features in the merged layer that intersect with the offending vertical streets, creating a new selection. Then dissolve this selection using &quot;Vector / Geoprocessing Tools / Dissolve&quot;, choosing  in the &quot;Dissolve field&quot;. Note that this approach can lead to the undesired dissolution of &quot;proper&quot; polygons if the offending vertical street is on the boundary of two other polygons, or if there are offending vertical streets within two neighbouring polygons.\nIf you want to avoid dissolving other polygons, you can manually select the vertical streets and one adjacent polygon, taking care not to select two neighbouring polygons, and then dissolving them as above.\n\n\n",

I have successfully used R to load the shapefile and plotted various maps using  as described in this question. It&#39;s all working rather well. \n\nNow I would like to create a new polygon of arbitrary shape, add it to the map, then calculate the population living in the area lying under the shape, which might cover or partially cover multiple divisions. I have the population for each electoral division and I can make the simplifying assumption that the population in each ward is uniformly distributed. That suggests the following steps.\n\n1) Overlay a new shape on the map that partially covers multiple electoral divisions. Let&#39;s say there are 3 divisions, for the sake of argument. It would look something like this. [Edit: except that in the image below the shape straddles 5 divisions rather than 3]\n\n\n\n2) Calculate the percentage of the area of each of these 3 divisions that intersects with the overlaid polygon.\n\n3) Estimate population by getting the percentage of the area of each division covered by the overlaid shape and multiplying this by the population of each division.\n\nI think I can probably work out how to create the polygon and overlay it on the map i.e. add it to the existing data frame using the useful answer to this and other questions. The bit that worries me is the task of working out the percentage of each division that is covered by the overlaid shape.

The map that forms the base for the image above was created with the following:\n\n\n\nMy second question is: am I using the right tools?

The definition given by ESRI states that a GCS uses a three-dimensional spherical surface to define locations on the earth. Basically, a GCS is used to define your real world points on a 3 dimensional digital surface. Examples of this include WGS84 (World Geodetic Survey 1984), NAD83 (North American Datum 1983), or NAD27 (used before NAD83. North American Datum 1927)\n\nThe other is a Projected Coordinate System or PCS. A PCS is used to take those points that you defined with your GCS and translate them to a 2-dimensional surface. This is what people commonly refer to as a &quot;projection&quot;. This can include things like Robinson, Albers Equal Area, and (one of my personal favorites) Waterman butterfly.\n\nThese are different parts and are made up of different pieces, but both of these together create a coordinate system. This is the very simple definition of both, but if you want to get into the math of everything, ESRI has good documentation in their resources section discussing map projections. Wikipedia&#39;s page on map projections also does a very good job of explaining the different types of PCSs, what distortions are caused, etc. Many projections also have their own pages explaining their history, math, etc.\n",

            "body": "There is a good information about these terms on Basudeb Bhatta&#39;s Blog at this link, copied below. \n\n@Brad Nesom&#39;s definitions are good but I thought that geodata was an abbreviation of &quot;geographic data.&quot; However, Brad&#39;s definition of geodata is quite logical.\n\nBeside these in my opinion:\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n  Often my students ask about the difference(s) between spatial and\n  geospatial. These two words appear very frequently in remote sensing\n  and GIS literature.\n  \n  The word spatial originated from Latin &#39;spatium&#39;, which means space.\n  Spatial means &#39;pertaining to space&#39; or &#39;having to do with space,\n  relating to space and the position, size, shape, etc.&#39; (Oxford\n  Dictionary), which refers to features or phenomena distributed in\n  three-dimensional space (any space, not only the Earth&#39;s surface) and,\n  thus, having physical, measurable dimensions. In GIS, &#39;spatial&#39; is\n  also referred to as &#39;based on location on map&#39;.\n  \n  Geographic(al) means &#39;pertaining to geography (the study of the\n  surface of the earth)&#39; and &#39;referring to or characteristic of a\n  certain locality, especially in reference to its location in relation\n  to other places&#39; (Macquarie Dictionary). Spatial has broader meaning,\n  encompassing the term geographic. Geographic data can be defined as a\n  class of spatial data in which the frame is the surface and/or\n  near-surface of the Earth. &#39;Geographic&#39; is the right word for graphic\n  presentation (e.g., maps) of features and phenomena on or near the\n  Earth&#39;s surface. Geographic data uses different feature types (raster,\n  points, lines, or polygons) to uniquely identify the location and/or\n  the geographical boundaries of spatial (location based) entities that\n  exist on the earth surface. Geographic data are a significant subset\n  of spatial data, although the terms geographic, spatial, and\n  geospatial are often used interchangeably.\n  \n  Geospatial is another word, and might have originated in the industry\n  to make the things differentiate from geography. Though this word is\n  becoming popular, it has not been defined in any of the standard\n  dictionary yet. Since &#39;geo&#39; is from Greek &#39;gaya&#39; meaning Earth,\n  geospatial thus means earth-space. NASA says &#39;geospatial means the\n  distribution of something in a geographic sense; it refers to entities\n  that can be located by some co-ordinate system&#39;. Geospatial data is to\n  develop information about features, objects, and classes on Earth&#39;s\n  surface and/or near Earth&#39;s surface. Geospatial is that type of\n  spatial data which is related to the Earth, but the terms spatial and\n  geospatial are often used interchangeably. United States Geological\n  Survey (USGS) says &quot;the terms spatial and geospatial are equivalent&quot;.\n\n",

            "body": "Actually it&#39;s not all that situation dependent and is all about statistical error.\n\nAny time you resample to a higher resolution, you are introducing false accuracy. Consider a set of data measured in feet at whole numbers only. Any given point may be +/- 0.5 feet from its actual location. If you resample to the nearest tenth, you are now saying any given number is no more than +/- 0.1 from its actual location. Yet you know your original measurements were not that accurate, and you are now operating within the margin of error. However if you go the other way and resample to the lower resolution, you know that any given point value is definitely accurate because it is contained within the larger sample&#39;s margin of error.\n\nOutside of statistical math, the first place that this comes to mind is in land surveying. Older surveys only specified bearings down to the nearest half-minute and distances to the tenth of a foot. Plotting a boundary traverse with these measurements can often result in a misclosure (the start point and end point should be the same but are not) measured in feet. Modern surveys go to at least the nearest second and hundreth of a foot. Derived values (such as the area of a lot) can be significantly affected by the difference in precision. The derived value itself can also be given as overly precise. \n\nIn your analysis case, if you resample to the higher resolution your results will imply a much greater accuracy than the data on which they are based. Consider your SRTM at 90m. By whatever method they measure the elevation (avg/max/mean return), the smallest unit (pixel) that can be differentiated from its neighbors is 90m. If you resample that to 30m, either:\n\n\nyou assume all nine of the resulting pixels are that same elevation when in\ntruth maybe only one - the center, or the top left - (or none!) is\nyou interpolate between pixels, creating derived values not present\nbefore\n\n\nThus in both cases you introduce false accuracy because your new subsamples were not actually measured.\n\nRelated question: What practices are available for modelling land suitability?\n",

            "body": "To solve the problem one needs to transform 2D images of 3D structures from different angles/perspectives into a solid model. This was earlier a manual job, but software allows for automated processes.\nRemember that processing software could provide both digital surface models (DSM) or digital elevation models (DEM)\nProducts from such processes can include Digital Elevation Models as well as Point Clouds, Digital Surface Models, Textured Digital Surface Models, Orthorectified Imagery and Classified Point Clouds. This is known as Structure from Motion analysis.\nProcessing can be done locally, through online services or a combination of the two. The software is basically the same, although one will find that local processing allows for more specialized settings.\nLocal processing\n\npix4D is an overall good tool providing exceptional ease of use for inexperienced to more experienced users. In addition to provide a desktop tool it also integrates with a cloud based service. A youtube video introduces the software in a good way. It is a bit in the high end with re to price.\nAgisoft Metashape (formerly known as PhotoScan) is available for Windows, OSX and Linux. Agisoft is flexible on the platform side. Having tried it out it produces good terrain models and ortophotos. A feature which lacks on Pix4D is the ability to set up batch jobs. You can also script the processing using a python API.\nDrone2Map from ESRI can create orthomosaics, 3D meshes and more. This is not an integrated ArcGIS desktop tool, but effectively a stand alone 64 bit application. On their webpage they state that: &quot;Drone2Map for ArcGIS is powered by Pix4D.&quot; Opposed to Pix4D the information provided to the user while calculating is poor. From what I understand this is Pix4D under the hood under a different licensing model.\nOpenDroneMap now provides a desktop version, WebODM, which runs fine on a desktop computer. It will let you create good ortophotos, digital elevation models as well as the rest of the products mentioned in the beginning of this answer. Set up correctly the tool can process projects of more than 4.000 images. It is important the computer has enough memory to do the processing. 32 GB or more is advised for projects over 2.000 pictures. You can also find code and more on github.\nERDAS Imagine have an UAV add-in module. Combined it&#39;s more expensive than Agisoft Photoscan, but if you&#39;re already an ERDAS user it integrates really well.\n3Dsurvey in addition to imagery analysis also offers what looks like good point cloud editing tools.\nOnline services\n\nProcessing of aerial imagery is resource demanding and will require some serious hardware. Online services are therefore pay-as-you-go or tied to a license.\nDronemapper is an online service where you can upload imagery and have it processed.\nDronedeploy was initially made as a planning and processing framework for DJI drones. It now supports creating maps and 3D models for any drone imagery. One can also do analysis based on the imagery. Produces good maps. Their app is also a marketplace where you can install apps for free.\nMicaSense MicaSense Atlas is a cloud-based data platform for processing, storage, management, presentation, and analytics of multispectral data captured with professional multispectral cameras like the MicaSense RedEdge and Parrot Sequoia.\nMaps Made Easy is another provider of online processing and data management.\n3Dsurvey Is also an option.\nCombined services\npix4D also provides an online processing service for users with a desktop license.\nApps\nApps seem to be more and more popular. They usually serve several purposes.\n\nHelp the user to plan surveys\nTake pictures according to the plan\nUpload survey plans to the drone\nProvide updated information from the drone during a survey\nHelp the user to adjust plans during a survey based on earlier flights\nFacilitate for upload of data so that data can be processed using an online service.\n\nDroneDeploy has an app which has an extraordinary update rate. The app is very flexible and also has an option to use plugins to focus the survey effort. Recent (July 2017) updates fixed issues with image spacing, but at the same time put limitations on the flight speed.\nPix4D Capture provides a stable work tool for collecting aerial images. It is probably the best available. On the downside the app has some shortcomings (unclear exposure settings, accurate control of speed, manual and not flexible way of controlling flight direction, lacking upload of survey areas (only android has this) and more) which should be fixed. It is rarely updated.\nDronelink and Litchi allow programmatically controlling your drone, including flying a structured mapping mission among others. Pricing can be more affordable compared to some of the above, especially for individuals. Dronelink in particular is usable for mapping with the DJI Mini, which otherwise does not allow enough automated control using some of the other apps.\nObsolete\nVisualSFM is a software package which in combination with CSVS might be a way to go. A youtube movie on the www.flightriot.com webpage gives a practical example of potential endpoint products. The resulting products are not referenced and as such not useful for GIS work. Visual SFM seems to be a project which lacks momentum. As far as I can see there has not been any development on the software for a couple of years.\n",

            "body": "The problem is poorly documented by authoritative sources for English speakers, despite affecting millions of people on an everyday basis. I&#39;ve spend the past two days trying to understand the situation and I&#39;ve created a Wikipedia article about the restrictions on mapping in China and about the China GPS shift problem. Below is the part of my research that answers the question.\n\nThe root of the problem is the severe restrictions that the Chinese State Council places on geographic data concerning China&#39;s air, land and waters. Mapping and surveying can only be done with authorization from the State Council, and foreigners must form a joint-venture in order to be granted authorization for surveys. There have been numerous examples of fines levied against individuals and companies breaking this (cough protectionist and isolationist cough) law.\n\nOnline map providers offering street maps of China must obtain an authorization from the State Council. These maps must use the GCJ-02 datum, instead of the WGS-84 that the most of the world uses. This causes WGS-84 coordinates, such as those coming from a regular GPS chip, to be plotted incorrectly on GCJ-02 maps. \n\n\n\nThe street maps displayed by both google.com/maps and google.cn/maps use GCJ-02 coordinates. This can be proved by getting the GPS (WGS-84) coordinates of a known landmark, such as the Monument to the People&#39;s Heroes in Shanghai, which is located at 31.24427 N, 121.48695 E:\n\n\nTerraserver satellite imagery - reference\nGoogle China street maps and satellite imagery for the same coordinates displays a location about 500 meters off to the north-west. To find the landmark, you must use the GCJ-02 location, 31.2423 N, 121.4914 E\nGoogle.com street maps in China also gets it wrong, and it also requires the GCJ-02 coordinates to zero in on the landmark correctly.\nGoogle.com Maps satellite imagery uses the WGS-84 coordinates, which causes a pretty terrible mismatch:\n\n\n\n\nI&#39;m still unclear as to whether GPS chips manufactured in China return GCJ-02 coordinates directly, or if they return WGS-84 coordinates, which approved map software can convert to GCJ-02.\n",

Local law enforcement has started cracking down on use text messaging and cell phone use in school zones.  This presents a problem for parents picking up kids after  a middle school function.  Even for those who flaunt the law, the cell tower quickly becomes overloaded when hundreds of kids call their parents at once.  The campus is large, with wifi coverage.  It seems like it should be possible to write a mobile app that would allow a cell phone user to send a text message containing a list of wifi signal strengths to a webservice.  The web service would then create a location fix and push the message to the parent&#39;s on board navigation device.  The parent would then drive to the correct location on the campus.  \n\nBackyard Use Case (original)\nWhen I take my laptop into my backyard and choose &quot;view available networks&quot; I see a list of my 4 neighbors.  As I walk around, the relative signal strengths from my neighbors changes.\n\nI&#39;d like to stand with my laptop at known locations in my back yard, click on the map and collect points with 4 different signal strengths.\n\nAfter collecting a lot (but not too many) of these calibration points, I&#39;d like to then write a program that takes 4 wifi signal strength levels and estimates a location in the form of an error ellipse. The signals might be measured using a different device than the one used to collect the original calibration points.  \n\nWhat algorithm should I use?\n\nI do not want to disturb my neighbors by asking them if I can come in and survey the exact location of their router.\n\nI can assume, however, the location of my neighbors routers does not change.\n",

            "body": "This happens often with ST_Intersection, irrespective of whether you use ST_SnapToGrid (which is more useful for ensuring a certain precision than for fixing geometry errors) and ST_MakeValid. The problem is to do with the fact that when you intersect polygons, often they will meet at a single point or along a line, as well as producing a (Multi)Polygon intersection(s). That is, when you intersect any two polygons, they can have multiple intersections, not all of which will be polygonal. Consequently, the data type for that particular intersection will be a GeometryCollection. As you are then attempting to insert this into a MultiPolygon or Polygon field, you will see errors about non-noded intersection or self-intersections. The simplest way I have found to fix this issue is using ST_CollectionExtract which allows you to extract only Points, Linestrings or Polygon types from the GeometryCollection. In your case, using the parameter 3 (for polygons) and dropping ST_MakeValid ought to fix it:\n\n\n\nThe error you are seeing is consistent with your polygons all being valid in the first place, as you state. I generally think it is better to run ST_IsValid to check and in the case of errors,  ST_MakeValid, on geometries before doing any intersections -- as you have done. ST_MakeValid and ST_SnapToGrid have other uses, but are generally not the right tool for fixing geometry collection issues within a query.\n\nEDIT. After a lot of (unsuccessful) fiddling in an attempt to narrow down a specific subset of the polygons that cause this error, we had an insight from the comments. The input data, from the UK Ordnance Survey, originally in CRS 27700 had been reprojected to 4326. As the algorithm for this conversion is based on convergence, rather than being one step, it introduces arbitrary rounding errors into the reprojected geometries. From reading various GEOS mailing lists about the cause of the OP&#39;s error, relating to precision and rouding, we came to this realization. The OP has since re-run this job using the original 27700 data with no error. \n",

            "body": "Disclaimer: Any method you use to do this, especially with a consumer GPS unit, is going to be an approximation at best. If you truly want to know where the boundaries are, you will need to locate property pins/corners which might require a metal detector. Your best, safest option is to hire a professional land surveyor.\n\nNo, those are not lat/longs in the description. Those are bearings and distances. What you have is a metes and bounds description which locates a point, gives bearing and distance to the next point, and so on all the way around and back to the point of beginning (known as a traverse). Such descriptions usually, and in the case of the example you give, refer to the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) in the US.\n\nTo locate a section corner you&#39;ll need to either estimate it from data or find a benchmark. For some states you can locate a GIS version of the PLSS grid - see PLSS shapefiles - alternative to geocommunicator.gov? But do note those aren&#39;t surveyed - some points are (control network) and the rest are calculated to fit. You could also check with the county to see if they make their survey control network available. This would have actual surveyed corners and locations of benchmark monuments, possibly with lat/long coordinates already provided. You&#39;d have to locate the nearest benchmark and work your way to it - the plat survey should have note on it somewhere of such a benchmark. If all you have is the description, you&#39;re on your own. And since you&#39;ll be starting at a quarter-quarter corner, you&#39;re unlikely to find a monument right there (they&#39;re usually sections or quarters at best).\n\nOnce you find that point, from your example the description starts immediately. In some cases there are commencement calls that get you to a true point of beginning, and then the shape starts. From there it&#39;s an orienteering exercise.\n\nTo get all this into GPS coordinates, you&#39;ll need to know at least one point&#39;s lat/long and work out the rest, or plot the description and unproject it to a geographic coordinate system. A related question, though for a different country, can be found at Outline a plot of land on a map. You don&#39;t mention what software you&#39;re using or have access to. If you specify something, more help could be given.\n\nHonestly, your best bet is to go to the county GIS website (per your descripton). Using their online map application, you can get a pretty good idea of where the parcel is and possibly turn imagery on to get some landmarks to use in locating it. Their section grid is on by default, zoom in far enough and you&#39;ll be able to see the labels to locate 03-25-2E per their labeling scheme. Looks like it&#39;s on the north end of the City of Bainbridge Island. Since I can&#39;t see the full description, nor do I know exactly where the quarter-quarter corners are, I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s one of the parcels in the vicinity of the one outlined in green below. The SE corner of the SW4 NW4 is somewhere around the bottom right corner of that parcel. I&#39;ve outlined the section in red, because the gray dashed line they use is kind of hard to see. If the documents you have include a parcel ID number or address, you can look that up directly in the system.\n\n\n\nYou can also use that page to identify the correct parcel, and then pull it up in Google Maps where if you right-click a point and choose What&#39;s Here? it will give you the lat/long coordinates of that point. So you could get a rough idea where the corners are and then get ballpark coordinates to use in your GPS. Which remember a consumer grade unit is only going to be accurate down to about 3m anyway.\n",

However, ESRI has a glossary of GIS terms, so I just looked them up. The definitions are similar or identical to the wiki GIS glossary as well.\n\nBounding Box (Bounding Rectangle):\n\n\n  [map display] The rectangle, aligned with the coordinate axes and\n  placed on a map display, that encompasses a geographic feature or\n  group of features or an area of interest. It is defined by minimum and\n  maximum coordinates in the x and y directions and is used to\n  represent, in a general way, the location of a geographic area.\n\n\nExtent:\n\n\n  The minimum bounding rectangle (xmin, ymin and xmax, ymax) defined by\n  coordinate pairs of a data source. All coordinates for the data source\n  fall within this boundary.\n\n\nIt should be noted that in the arcpy documentation for extent (though you haven&#39;t said which software you&#39;re using), the definition is essentially the same:\n\n\n  An extent is a rectangle specified by providing the coordinate of the\n  lower left corner and the coordinate of the upper right corner in map\n  units.\n\n\nExtent Rectangle (you didn&#39;t ask for this one, but it was in the glossary so I threw it in):\n\n\n  [ESRI software] A rectangle that is displayed in one data frame,\n  showing the size and position of another data frame.\n\n\nThe glossary doesn&#39;t have a definition for bounds, but I think it would likely be similar or identical to extent.  It should be noted there is also a term called &quot;metes and bounds&quot;, which is not really what you&#39;re asking, but I thought I would include it anyway.\n\nMetes and Bounds:\n\n\n  A surveying method in which the limits of a parcel are identified as\n  relative distances and bearings from landmarks. Metes and bounds\n  surveying often resulted in irregularly shaped areas.\n\n\nFinally, there is a tool in ArcGIS called Minimum Bounding Geometry which:\n\n\n  Creates a feature class containing polygons which represent a\n  specified minimum bounding geometry enclosing each input feature or\n  each group of input features.\n\n\nDepending on which option you choose, the results will be different.  However, it&#39;s worth noting that the Envelope option is a polygon which appears to be to be identical to the extent.\n",

            "body": "Short Answer:\nQGIS handles SRS much the same as ESRI.  Dive into QGIS and you&#39;ll find all your favorite SRS waiting for you.\n\nLong Answer:\nEPSG is the European Petroleum Survey Group.  It provides &#39;official&#39; spatial reference systems and spheroids and its codes are ubiquitous.  ESRI \ntakes most of its SRS from the EPSG dataset.  So you are already using the EPSG SRS, except ESRI just doesn&#39;t tell you the catalog number in an obvious way.  ESRI has a few &#39;interesting&#39; SRS that are not available in the EPSG catalog (e.g. the Dymaxion and a cube projection) but they are not in common use.  \n\nQGIS uses the EPSG naming convention but provides common names too so you should not get lost if you are familiar with ESRI.  Coming from ESRI, the EPSG codes can seem a bit alien at first, but you quickly get used to it as you realise that you&#39;ve been using it all along.  \n\nLastly we have the user-defined SRS group.  These have no official status.  It is possible to define your own projection system (as you can in ArcGIS) but the need to do so is rare as there are so many tried and tested SRS out there and correctly defining an SRS is (IMO) a non-trivial task if you want to have something reliable and then have to convince all your co-workers that it is both credible and necessary.  Personally, I would be a bit suspicious of any of the User-defined SRS as I do not know their provenance or accuracy and would have to spend time researching their composition. I&#39;d rather use an EPSG SRS that has good documentation and is well supported.\n\nWhile we&#39;re on the subject, ESRI also borrows parts of GDAL so you are also using some of QGIS&#39; raster handling capabilities (particularly for converting between ratser data types)... you may not be aware of that either, but it should give you a bit of additional comfort moving to QGIS.\n",

GPX files are a terrific way of keeping all (or almost all) of your GPS data in one place \u2013&#160;they are xml files that store tracklog, waypoint &amp; route information in one convenient format. They store multiple tracks, even old saved tracks from a Garmin. \n\nI&#39;d like to store all this track data in a spatialite database, in parallel with other tables that have point observational data from the same survey.\n\nogr2ogr will let me convert the track to a spatialite database:\n\n\n\nHowever, this imports each saved track as a line \u2013 losing the time / location information for each track point!\n\nAnyone know of any clever ways of building a tracklog database that will preserve that information?\n\nEDIT:\n\nTracklogs are not just a line - they are collections of sequential points, each with an elevation and time attribute. Each point belongs to a track segment, which in turn belong to a given track, and points within each track segment were taken without interruption and may be assumed to be linked. For example:\n\n\n\nThus, to save a tracklog you need to save this collection of points with their associated data.\n\nOne solution might be to load these tracks as points, with additional columns for track name, segment, elevation and time; I don&#39;t think ogr will convert the tracks as points, though.\n\nSolution\n\nThanks to @scruss who pointed out gpx2spatialite, which I installed (OS X 10.9) with . This set of tools is designed for the &#39;drawinglife&#39; project (and thus has some &#39;city&#39; information that is probably unnecessary for most of us); the main gpx2spatialite page doesn&#39;t explain much, but the drawinglife wiki is better. Still, lots of undocumented features - like removing duplicates!\n\nCreate a spatialite database for GPX files which will hold track segments, tracks, trackpoints and waypoints. It also has &#39;users&#39; set up (which seems odd, since sqlite is not a user-access system, but was meant for drawinglife) designed to label the various tracks:\n\n\n\nLoad a whole folder of GPX files, including all subfolders, checking and removing duplicates along the way:\n\n\n\nOptions:\n\n\n= don&#39;t check if the trackpoints are in the city database (speeds it up a LOT)\n = database to use;\n = add the user SL25 (just a label I used for the set of tracks collected);\n = the folder (with subfolders) that has the tracks I&#39;m interested in.\n\n\nBugs:\n\n\nIf you have saved tracks on an older Garmin that discards time stamp info, it&#39;ll crash the import (remove those saved tracks using a utility like GPSU). If you have gpsbabel, filter the file first with something like:\n\ngpsbabel -w -r -t -i gpx -f [INPUT.gpx] -x track,start=20000101 -o gpx -F [OUTPUT.gpx]\n\n",

I have the data in Fusion Tables now and it all looks great except for one blatant gap in the coverage.\n\nWhen I look at the KML data for the missing local authority, it hasn&#39;t imported at all (ie the cell is empty). I&#39;ve tried re-uploading the geometry (and re-downloading and re-converting) and Fusion Tables is definitely rejecting it as KML. I&#39;ve read somewhere that Fusion Tables can mess around with your geometry somewhat, so I uploaded the KML file and pointed Google Maps directly at it and that didn&#39;t work either (I don&#39;t know how good a test that is).\n\nI don&#39;t know that I originally created a valid GML file (I don&#39;t know the standard) but they seemed to import ok to QGIS and the final result looks great apart from this one place. The area is visible in QGIS when I load the GML file, so I don&#39;t know if QGIS is producing invalid KML, or mayble Google Maps/Fusion Tables have limitations?\n\n\n\nI&#39;ve downloaded the OS Open data pointed to by @nhopton, loaded the appropriate layer into QGIS (Layer -&gt; Add vector layer), saved it as KML (Layer -&gt; Save as) and uploaded it to Fusion Tables.

Generally it&#39;s worked well (and importantly the particular area that had failed with my first method worked with this, so I have the missing geometry!). However, there&#39;s a number of missing areas again. And in this case, there&#39;s much less that I&#39;ve done to the data myself, so it&#39;s not so easy to assume I&#39;ve just messed up the data. Any ideas why my final results look like this?\n",

For example, you can use this\n  Split option to break a line into pieces that are the same length.\n  This functionality is similar to the Divide command available in\n  previous ArcGIS releases.\n\n\nFurther down on the same page is a section on &quot;Splitting lines proportionally&quot;.  This should help you with the second part of your question, although you will need at least a Standard (ArcEditor) license to do this.\n\n\n  The Proportion command Proportion on the COGO toolbar splits a\n  selected line feature into a number of segments, based on specified\n  distance values. If there is a difference between the feature length\n  and the entered values, this difference is proportioned between all\n  the new segments. Proportion is useful when you are working with exact\n  measurements, such as COGO or survey data.\n  \n  For example, you have line features that need to be split into\n  specific lengths. The example below shows a line feature that needs to\n  be split into four parts: 13.79 feet, 48 feet, 60 feet, and 60 feet.\n  The Proportion command is used to split this feature into the four new\n  features.\n\n\nAs stated above, in previous versions of ArcGIS, dividing lines into segments was accomplished using the Divide command.\n",

Scale ratios are relative to printed documents not computer screens.  What you need  for these images to be used with any accuracy is to know the dimension of each pixel then scale the image according to whatever your overlaying it with.\n\nSo back 15-20 year ago someone took WGS-84 as base data.  (note in a previous post someone used a value of 40,075,160  I&#39;ve seen this in Wikipedia a few places and it&#39;s incorrect.   The correct value is 40,075,017\n\nThey then took that and divided it by a full 32 bit integer.  This is a logical choice as it yields global accuracy to about one centimeter which is plenty for aerial imagery. 32 bit integers are also efficient to store and process.\n\nWhy this is level 24 was chosen I don&#39;t know however as someone else here worked out 0 gets you down to one 256 pixel tile for the earth.\n\nNow for an example of how to use the above data.  Lets say I have an image at zoom level 20 (as zoomed as they currently let you get)  Take 0.009330692 (Zoom 24 at equator) double it for zoom 23, again for zoom 22, again for zoom 21 and one last time for zoom 20.  You should now have 0.149231071.  \n\nNow lets say our image is at latitude 45.  Take the Cosine of that (0.707106781) and multiply it by our 0.149231071 and it will give you  0.105564729 meters.  That is the length and height of one pixel from an image at latitude 45 at zoom level 20.  If you screen capture a 1000 x 1000 pixel image of that area the dimension are 105.56 meters square.  If you want feet divide that 0.3048\n\nAs for sources I essencial reversed engineer about 5 years ago from various bit of info and documentation I found on the web including Google and MS mapping support sites.\n\nI have used this hundred of time and overlaying it with actually field survey data and its always been correct.

See for example section 2.6 &quot;How to Join the ACS Summary File to the TIGER/Line Shapefiles&quot; of the 2006-2010 ACS 5-Year Summary File Technical Documentation.\n\nIn the ACS, GEOID begins as follows:\n\n\n3 digits for the summary level\n\n\n040 = state\n050 = county\netc...\n\n2 characters for the component\n\n\nThere are a large number of geographic components, but mostly what you need to know is 00 means the entire population, while anything else means only part of the population, e.g. the urban part, the rural part, etc.\n\nThe letters US\n\n\nAfter those 7 characters which are not present in the TIGER/Line products, the ACS GEOID and TIGER/Line GEOID[10] fields will match. The code will be a concatenation of the code of every geographic entity in the hierarchy of that record. For a tract, this may be two digits for the state FIPS, three digits for the county FIPS, and six digits for the tract code\u2014or it may not, because another version of the census tract (summary level 080) follows the hierarchy State-County-County Subdivision-Place/Remainder-Census Tract.\n",

However, once you have attained a reputation of 20 you are free to seek career advice in our GIS Chat Room.\n\n\n\nA good way to get your hands dirty is to contribute to one of the many FOSS projects out there. For instance, there are over 600 bugs in the QGIS database. It also has a good plugin architecture, so if you can think of something that hasn&#39;t been covered, then write and contribute your own plugin. I&#39;m on the developer mailing list, and they&#39;re a good bunch of people always on the lookout for people willing to contribute.\n\nHave a look at the OSGEO website which has a number of open source projects under its auspices that you could contribute to, which gives you a chance to find an area you&#39;re interested in. In fact, as you&#39;re educated to degree level, it would be a good idea to start thinking about concentrating on a few areas of expertise - do you want to deal with database programming, cartography, or like me combining my degree in archaeology with my love of all things maps and programming to advance the use of GIS in archaeology.\n\nA possibility might be to see if your national mapping agency is hiring. I worked for the Ordnance Survey in the UK as a GIS programmer with no prior GIS experience apart from a love of maps.\n\nAs for colleges, it depends on which country you&#39;re in and whether you&#39;re willing to move. In the UK, Leeds, Edinburgh, and Sheffield, to name just a few, have GIS courses, but they tend to be part of a more general geography degree.\n\n\n\n&#39;Making sure that you understand geodesy..to me..the kind of ideas underpinning GIS is paramount.  I have taken trigonometry and an assorted list of math curriculum.  Please correct me if I am wrong, I think Trigonometry is important in GIS programming for figuring out route and relationships between GIS data..for example, if the user picks a point and then wants to create the nearest point on all lines in a line dataset in relation to that point...programmatically...\n\n\n\nIn Canada, Fleming College, Centre of Geographic Sciences (COGS) and BC Institute of Technology (BCIT) are good choices. All I would recommend beyond the scope of what you&#39;ll absorb in a post-grad is that you familiarize yourself with a greater range of open-source software. Mostly you&#39;ll learn using the ESRI suite, which is licensed to colleges free I believe, but many in the industry will opt to avoid the licensing fees or they like to juggle different software. Job postings frequently mention FME, PostGIS, Geoserver, etc.\n\nOne more thing. Even with a programming focus, you would do well to create a portfolio with some stellar maps. The industry cites map-production skills frequently. \n\nThe demand for fresh, skilled GIS workers does not seem great anymore though.\n",

Sounds like you downloaded the entire nationwide dataset? The one you refer to is from ACS 2009, Alaska, segment 0001 (because there are so many fields in the ACS summary file, the bureau segments them into more than 100 separate files for the estimates and 100 additional files containing margins of errors. These files have an &quot;m&quot;-prefix (for each state).\nYou will need the table headers, too. For ACS they are stored in xls files.\nSTFID is one way to uniquely refer to a block group. Another is LOGRECNO, which is the field actually found in the data files. You need to relate that using one of the geo files (also xls). For instance, the california one is here. STFID is a shorter version of column C (the last 15 or so characters; don&#39;t remember the exact number for block groups, but it identifies a two digit code for state, a three digit code for county, a six digit code for tract, and a (I think) four one digit code for block group). For example, a block group in San Francisco would be 060750101001  or so.\nIf you are only interested in a handful of variables it is a lot easier just to fetch those tables from American Factfinder. I think most ACS surveys are now on factfinder2.\nlastly, when I was dealing with this, I found this document useful, albeit for the five year sample.

I would like the new clipped files to look something like &#39;ID_247_clip&#39;.\nI&#39;ve done this via : input is Whole Region dNBR, overlay is plot locations. Then I&#39;ve clicked the  button. It gives me exactly what I need, just with the wrong title for the clipped layers.\nIs there a way to program the clip to name each layer according to the plot numbers in the ID field?\nI&#39;ve tried executing in batch mode but this doesn&#39;t work, as I only have one input and one overlay layer, whereas bulk seems to work for multiple input layers.\nAlso, a lot of the plot locations overlap, so I can&#39;t do anything like join by location.\n\n",

The options I have come up with are:\n\n\nIgnore SRID constraints and store all the data in one table, writing my front-end code to deal with manipulating the data in a consistent manner.\nStore all the data in one table, and rewrite the SRID constraint as a compound of SRID and survey ID.\nThrough table inheritance, create a new table for each new SRID.\nThrough table inheritance, create a new table for each survey.\n\n\n1 and 2 break some of the nice automated parts of PostGIS, but will be otherwise hidden in front-end code.

            "body": "Your choice of DSM vs DTM will depend on whether there is best-practice guidance or regulations governing the planning process for which you are performing the calculation.  \n\nFor instance, Viewshed Analysis for planning in the UK, especially for windfarms, requires that you use DTM data (and specifically Ordnance Survey data).  Analysis with DSM may be used as a supplementary presentation to demonstrate the screening effect of buildings and trees but a &#39;bald Earth&#39; calculation is the standard requirement.  The reason for this is that screening is rarely total and, in deciduous woodland areas, is also seasonal. On top of that trees can be cut down and buildings demolished.\n\nThis is why the phrases &#39;Zones of Theoretical Visibility&#39; (ZTV) or &#39;Zones of Visual Influence&#39; (ZVI) are used in many countries&#39; planning systems to describe the output of &#39;bald Earth&#39; (DTM) viewshed analysis, as it is the worst-case potential impact that is being measured.\n\nYou can only answer your question by reading the planning regulations that pertain to your country, state or province.   While we are on the subject, the relevant planning regulations will almost certainly also specify the resolution of data required.  If you are in doubt, my advice is to use a 10m resolution and present both a worst-case (DTM) and current-reality (DSM) viewsheds with a radius of 15km (for structures up to 50m).  Then describe/show the differences in a narrative or 3rd map.\n\nAs it is unlikely you are going to use a 0.5m resolution DTM over a radius of 10km plus, a further problem with trying to calculate &#39;true viewsheds&#39; is that small/thin features such as walls and hedges may well either not be represented at all in the DSM or be over-stated in some areas.  Any clever planner/lawyer can instantly nullify the validity of your entire DSM-based calculation by an argument based on this fact and suggest that you are claiming a false level of accuracy.  This is another reason why a worst-case analysis is often required because the analysis gives a definite baseline for theoretical visibility within which some screening may be achieved by small structures, eye-height differences etc.  In individual contentious locations you are well advised to preform a line of sight calculation based on site-surveyed data of tree and building heights and present that as profile drawings.\n\nGiven the resolution of your height data and common radii over which the viewshed analysis must normally be run, it therefore only really makes sense to consider large areas/structures such as entire Woodland blocks and towns or villages in a DSM-based calculation.  A common approach for the second part f your question is to perform the calculation normally with a Bald Earth DTM supplemented with DSM data or a simple addition of +15m in woodland areas and +5m for building footprints and then mask these areas in the output (clearly stating that you have done so in notes on the map). The figures of 15m and 5m are deliberately conservative to counter any arguments that your analysis is intentionally disingenuous in its suggestion of screening.  These are just commonly used values.  Whatever value you use will need to be justified.\n\nFinally, 1.5m is a common value for eye height, but then so is 2m.  You can argue the 2m represents a VERY tall person but the logic is again, worst-case scenario with some compensation for terrain inaccuracy.  Again, read your planning guidance because there may be a specific height prescribed which you MUST use.\n",

Having a MS opens doors in academia that would not normally exist with a BS.  For example, these are the education requirements for a mid-level research position in academia:  \n\n\n  Master\u2019s degree (or higher) in remote sensing, GIS, oceanography, or\n  related degree including a strong background in statistics,\n  mathematics, computer science, and/or engineering, and 2 years of\n  experience. \n  \n  OR \n  \n  Bachelor\u2019s degree in remote sensing, GIS, or related\n  science degree including a strong background in statistics,\n  mathematics, computer science, and/or engineering, and 5 years of\n  experience.\n\n\nLooking at the government sector, a MS is virtually required these days unless you have significant experience already.  The following are typical qualifications for a mid-level GIS job with the feds:\n\n\n  FOR THE GS-09 LEVEL, in addition to the educational requirements\n  listed above, applicants must have at least one year or twelve (12)\n  months of specialized experience equivalent to grade level GS-07 that\n  demonstrates:  work performing duties such as providing geographic\n  information systems (GIS) training and support with guidance for\n  resource conservation planning and the integration of GIS and planning\n  tools into daily operations; this would include business tools for a\n  variety of disciplines such as engineering, ecological, etc., and\n  other software applications as assigned; provide support with\n  assistance to state, field, and soil survey offices regarding ArcGIS,\n  soil data viewer, and other GIS software;  OR  applicants must have\n  two (2) years of progressively higher level graduate education leading\n  to a master&#39;s degree or master&#39;s or equivalent graduate degree\n  directly related to cartography.   Equivalent combinations of\n  education and experience are qualifying for this grade level.\n\n\nFor a mid-level private sector job (ESRI Support Analyst), the following requirements are nearly industry-wide:\n\n\n  Requirements:\n  \n  \n  Bachelor\u2019s in GIS, a related field, or equivalent work experience    while using GIS as a primary tool\n  \n  \n  Recommended Qualifications:\n  \n  \n  Master\u2019s in GIS, environmental science, geography, or other relevant    field\n  \n\n\nThe bottom line is a MS will jump start your career, provide increased opportunities and almost certainly yield a higher salary.\n",

The arboretum has been surveyed using GPS, and the specimen trees and plants become a point layer labelled with a reference number, which points to a description in the main catalogue.\n\nBecause of the site layout and orientation, the map needs to be rotated to fit comfortably on a rectangular canvas (paper, screen).  Fine, I can do that in print composer.  But that rotates the labels too, and for maximum legibility I want them to stay horizontal.\n\nI&#39;ve been experimenting with label placement. &quot;Around point&quot; gives significantly better results than &quot;Offset from point&quot;.  Using this method, the only way I&#39;ve found to apply a compensating rotation to the labels (so that when the map is rotated they end up back horizontal) is to add a &quot;rotation&quot; column to the attribute table and use data defined rotation.  But this to some extent messes up the label placement.  So my first question is:  is it possible to get the placement engine to run (again?) after the labels have been rotated?\n\nIf not, I would like to be able to reposition a few of the labels manually, but leave most of them automatically placed.  But if I add coordinate x and y columns to the attribute table and try to use data defined coordinates, then label rotation stops working if there is a NULL value in either or both of the x and y coordinate columns.  I can&#39;t leave most of the points to be automatically placed and just fix a few - effectively I have to do manual placement for all of them if I want to do it for any of them.  Since there are approx. 200 of the things, that&#39;s a major chore.  Have I missed something?\n\nSome of this might be easier if the &quot;Move label&quot; button would work.  But however I&#39;ve fiddled - with editing on/off, data defined placement on/off and so on - I&#39;ve never seen the thing not greyed out.  What do I need to do to get this working?\n\nThe best I&#39;ve been able to do is have a data defined distance override for some points.  This is rather hit and miss, because there&#39;s not much control over where the label will actually go, and it has unpredictable knock-on, domino effects on other labels some of which may end up worse than they were before.  But it doesn&#39;t affect label rotation.\n",

Therefore the +towgs84  parameters were invented. But these even change across the country.
