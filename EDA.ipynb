            "Título: None, Pregunta: 1. What is a land survey?, Texto: A land survey is a report in the form of a map showing the location of a parcel of real property. The map will also show the location of visible improvements on and adjacent to the property.\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: 2. Why are land surveys so important?, Texto: Prior to the closing on your new home purchase, a land survey provides important information to you as the buyer. The survey map will show the limits of the land you are purchasing and identify any conflicts in your deed. It will also allow you to see if improvements such as driveways, fences, wells or even dwellings encroach over the property lines. Any existing property corner markers found by the surveyor will also be shown on the map.\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: 3. How is a land survey performed?, Texto: The land surveyor's responsibility is to locate on the ground the boundaries of the land described in the deed. The surveyor also examines and maps various visible and apparent man-made and natural features as required for the purpose of the survey. Recorded deeds and maps are investigated along with the information and documentation supplied to the surveyor by the owner or title company. Additionally, extensive data gathering is preformed at and around the site.\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: 4. Why have I been asked if I want property markers set?, Texto: In the course of performing a survey in New Jersey, State law requires that a land surveyor place permanent markers at all property corners where none currently exist. You may sign a written waiver instructing the surveyor to omit this work.\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: 5. Why should I not waive the marking of property corners?, Texto: Boundary lines shown on a survey map of the property may be difficult to locate accurately on the ground without markers denoting the corners of the property. Placing markers helps to avoid future disputes and enables you to identify the physical location of your property.\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: 6. Who can do a land survey?, Texto: In New Jersey a land survey may only be performed and signed by a licensed Professional Land Surveyor.\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: 7. What is required to become a Professional Land Surveyor?, Texto: To meet the qualifications for licensure in New Jersey, an individual must have a four year college degree in Surveying, three years or more of practical experience, and pass a 16 hour written examination administered by the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs. Once licensed, the Professional Land Surveyor must obtain 24 hours of continuing education credits every two years to maintain active status.\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: 8. How does a land survey help identify title to property?, Texto: Land surveys identify the record title lines of your property. The survey map shows the limits of the land that you are purchasing. A land survey certified to you provides critical information which, when used with title insurance, allows the buyer to make informed decisions and negotiate with the seller to correct any defects prior to the purchase. A land survey prepared for you and certified to you and to your title company affords important protection against claims which may arise after the closing.\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: 9. What is title insurance and how does a land survey expand its coverage?, Texto: Title insurance protects the mortgage lender and the property owner (if insured) against claims to the property such as a disputed property boundary line. Most mortgage lenders require the home buyer to purchase a title insurance policy in the lender's name. This is called a Lender's policy.Title insurance policies do not provide coverage for encroachments, easements and boundary line disputes which would be disclosed by a current certified survey. This is known as the Survey Exception. Mortgage lenders routinely require a Survey Endorsement to their loan policies which limits the scope of the Survey Exception to the specific problems disclosed by the survey. In other words, a Survey Endorsement provides coverage against possible undiscovered problems involving encroachments, easements and boundary line disputes.\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: None, Texto: To protect yourselves as home buyers you should insist on an Owner's Policy with a Survey Endorsement based on a professionally prepared current land survey.\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: 10. What can you do to protect the investment in you home?, Texto: Buying a home is usually the single largest purchase you will ever make! It makes sound financial sense as well as good common sense to protect this important asset. A land survey prepared by a licensed Profession Land Surveyor is a cornerstone of protection and preservation of home ownership. Remember, a lender's Policy protects the bank but not the homeowner. As you make the major investment of purchasing a home you should insist on an Owner's Policy of Title Insurance with the Survey Endorsement and a current land survey certified to you.\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: 1) What is a land or property survey?, Texto: In the simplest terms, a land survey is a graphic depiction of a property, much like a map, outlining its\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: None, Texto: legal boundaries and other features. Land surveys are typically required during real estate transactions and are an extremely useful tool to best understand a property and its improvements at the time of the survey. While not always the case, surveys are typically ordered and paid for by the property owner during the property purchase process.\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: None, Texto: Topography Surveys:\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: None, Texto: Different from a common land survey and not required at the closing of a real estate transaction, a topographic survey gathers data about the elevation of points on a piece of land and presents them as contour lines on a plot. The purpose of a topographic survey is to collect survey data about the natural and man-made features of the property, as well as its elevations.\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: None, Texto: Topographic maps are used to show elevations and grading features for architects, engineers,\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: None, Texto: and building contractors in addition to the land survey.\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: 2) Who owns the survey?, Texto: Property owners are responsible for purchasing and storing a property survey. It is not a municipal document and therefore the City of Summit neither generates nor is required to keep a current copy of a property survey on file. It is ordered by, paid for, and kept by the property owner.\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: 3) How are land surveys created?, Texto: Only a licensed surveyor can produce an official land survey. Professional land surveyors lay out the\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: None, Texto: exact dimensions of a property and its improvements by using a deed for the property and a site visit to properly measure and document it. If you do not have a current survey or order one as a part of a real estate closing, you can retain a licensed professional to conduct one. The city does not recommend surveyors. Seek referrals from neighbors, a realtor, real estate attorney, or from a professional association (www.plsanj.org or www.njspls.com).\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: 4) How much does a land survey cost?, Texto: While the cost of a land survey varies by the size and complexity of the plot, in general the\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: None, Texto: price can range from as low as $200 for a simple one-side boundary marking to over several thousand dollars for a full property survey.\n",

            "Título: None, Pregunta: None, Texto: Verification of boundary descriptions for all adjacent properties to ensure that property lines are defined exactly the same on all documents. Occasionally with older adjacent parcels, there may be a discrepancy over property lines; in such cases a surveyor can be retained to settle the dispute.\n",

            "Título: None, Pregunta: 6) What does it mean to have a land survey “to scale” and why is that necessary?, Texto: All exterior improvements made on a property typically require approval from the city’s Zoning Officer.\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: None, Texto: The city’s zoning ordinances (Chapter 35 of the city ordinances also known as the Development Regulations Ordinance or DRO) and the zone where a property exists dictates certain specific measurements and conditions including:\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: None, Texto: How close to a property line improvements can be made (setbacks)\n",

            "Título: None, Pregunta: None, Texto: How much lot coverage can exist before a maximum is exceeded (e.g. driveways, patios, etc.)\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: None, Texto: The Zoning Officer uses a property survey to measure existing conditions related to the improvements to approve a permit or improvement request.\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: None, Texto: To be most useful, a land survey must show locations and distances precisely and accurately on a single sheet of paper. The proportion chosen for a particular land survey is its scale. Simply defined, scale is the relationship between the distance on the survey and the distance on the ground (e.g. one inch on the survey equals 10 feet on the actual property). The copy in your possession that is to scale is the survey that is signed and stamped with a raised seal. All other copies may or may not be to scale depending on how they were duplicated.\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: 7) How is my survey not “to scale”?, Texto: Unfortunately, when property owners make copies of a survey or print from an electronic file (e.g. PDF), the scale becomes distorted by the setting of the copier or printer and alters the scale in a way that renders the survey invalid for zoning review. Again, the copy in your possession that will always be to scale is the one that is signed with a raised seal. All other copies may or may not be to scale, depending on how they were duplicated.\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: 8) What can I do if my survey is “not to scale?”, Texto: You will need to locate the original “to scale” survey that will need to be copied without maximizing or minimizing its size.

            "Título: None, Pregunta: What is Remote Sensing?, Texto: Remote sensing is a type of geospatial technology that samples emitted and reflected electromagnetic (EM) radiation from the Earth’s terrestrial, atmospheric, and aquatic ecosystems in order to detect and monitor the physical characteristics of an area without making physical contact. This method of data collection typically involves aircraft-based and satellite-based sensor technologies, which are classified as either passive sensors or active sensors.\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: None, Texto: ‍\n",

            "Título: None, Pregunta: None, Texto: A passive sensor detects and records naturally occurring electromagnetic energy as it is reflected or emitted from objects on the Earth’s surface. Your eyes are passive sensors because they collect energy (visible wavelengths) generated by the sun or another external source. Optical cameras, including those mounted on satellites, are another example of passive sensors.\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: None, Texto: An active sensor provides its own source of energy. The sensor emits a signal, in the form of electromagnetic energy, toward an area of interest on the Earth’s surface. This signal interacts with physical objects in that area, and is reflected or diffracted back toward the sensor, which then records and measures the signal. The process is similar to how mammals such as bats and whales use echolocation to sense objects in their path.\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: None, Texto: Because an active sensor functions without the need for an external energy source, it can collect information in the dark or through clouds—something that most passive sensors cannot do.

            "Título: None, Pregunta: None, Texto: Spatial resolution: The size of the smallest feature that can be detected or displayed. The higher the spatial resolution, the more detail it contains, and the greater the time and cost to capture and process the image. Depending on the size of the area to be imaged, active sensors can provide adjustable spatial resolution (e.g., images of very large areas will have coarse spatial resolution, while images of more focused areas will have higher resolution).\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: None, Texto: Temporal resolution: The time between data collections within an area. This depends on how long it takes for the satellite or other platform carrying the sensor to revisit an observation area.\n",

            "Título: None, Pregunta: None, Texto: Though a land surveyor is frequently associated with construction staking or engineering the main reason that land surveyors exist in the private sector is to find and identify boundary lines. The principle reason that a land surveyor is licensed in a given state is to serve and protect the public in regards to this fact. Boundary surveying is an evidence gathering process that starts in the office and then goes to the field to continue that gathering of evidence. In the end, the surveyor produces a document that shows the results of all this work. A land surveyor’s role is quasi-judicial, this means that we should not be biased or take sides in a given boundary dispute like an attorney would. Nor does a surveyor represent you like a real estate agent would. In both Arizona and Colorado, the State Statutes declare that to land survey, one must be licensed by the state.\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: Q:  What is a boundary survey?, Texto: A:  It is a type of land survey to locate boundary lines or one or more corners of a subject parcel. It is sometimes called a certified boundary survey. The document produced showing the results of this work is called a Record of Survey (ROS) in Arizona or a Land Survey Plat (LSP) in Colorado. This type of survey includes looking for existing boundary monuments on the subject parcel as well as looking for boundary monuments on adjacent parcels. At the end of the survey, we set any boundary monuments that are missing on the subject parcel. We have to do this level of work because no parcel sits independently – it has to be in harmony with the other parcels that surround it. We need to locate the boundary monuments on adjacent parcels in order to “prove” the boundary monuments on the subject parcel. The final drawing shows the results of this work and the boundary analysis. An ROS/LSP usually excludes showing physical features except along the boundary lines where fence/wall lines, tree lines, or hedge lines serve as boundary line evidence to consider during boundary analysis.\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: Q:  Will you identify the boundary monuments on site so that I can see where my corners are?, Texto: A:  Yes, For each boundary monument found or set on the subject parcel we also set a 4′ lath next to it and tie survey flagging on it so that it can be easily seen.\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: Q:  Is there a chance the boundary monuments are already there?, Texto: A:  Yes, most likely all or some of the boundary monuments marking the corners are there, possibly below grade where you can’t see them. This is part of what we look for when we do the field for a boundary survey and we set the boundary monuments that might be missing.\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: Q:  Would the final price of the survey vary depending on how many boundary monuments are already there?, Texto: A:  No, pricing is not on a per boundary monument basis. For surveying, costs are driven by two factors – amount of work involved and professional liability. Even if the boundary monuments are there, we still have the time and work involved to find them (this includes office research and calculations time as well as labor time in the field). Furthermore, it’s not just the subject parcel’s boundary monuments we have to look for. Professional surveying requires us also look for the pins on adjacent parcels as well in order to prove the ones on the subject parcel. Drive time to the site is also a factor. If the subject parcel is “out in the middle of nowhere” or at least a long drive from the surveyor’s office, this has to be factored into the price.\n",
            "Título: None, Pregunta: Q:  Is it possible to skip a full ROS/LSP and just have you come out and flag up my boundary monuments to save money?, Texto: A:  No, if we just come out and flag the boundary monuments where they are, without doing the work of evidence finding/analysis and locating other boundary monuments to check against, we are doing a dis-service to the public. If one or more of those boundary monuments are off, then we have told you that this is where your corner is, when that’s really not where it is. In addition to this, a surveyor just doesn’t magically know where boundary monuments are, there is a lot of pre-field-work research and calculations that have to be completed in the office prior to showing up on site of the subject parcel. This amount of work, combined with the reasons stated above, is why GLS does not engage in “find and flags”. In Colorado, the State Board that governs land surveyors actually frowns on this practice, this is partly because of the reasons stated above but also Colorado statutes clearly state that if we come out and participate in survey work, we have to deliver a document to you showing the results of that work.\n",

            "Título: None, Pregunta: None, Texto: In Arizona, if we have to set any missing boundary monuments on the subject parcel or upgrade a found boundary monument on the subject parcel, then yes, we have to record our survey per State Statutes. This recording is in the County Recorder’s Office so that it is in the public records database.\n",
