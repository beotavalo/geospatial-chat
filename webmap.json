Although there are many other proprietary software products for GIS, their market share is well below ESRI products (here, here and here although quite back dated). My opinion became stronger after joining GIS SE. Most of the questions, as well as the leading users (with highest reputation), are either for/interested in ESRI line of products or FOSS (of course apart from some questions related to data and theory). \n\nHowever this not the case in other streams of information technology, databases and programming languages in broad sense. I personally feel one reason could be the lack of interest by the software giants like Microsoft, Google or Oracle. While the first two have WebMaps, these are not WebGIS, and the spatial extension of Oracle is not fully GIS too. \n\nWhat are the major reasons for such a trend? There is nice article somewhat related to this, &quot; The Five Major Roadblocks to GIS Gaining Corporate Market Share&quot;. But this is not the answer I am looking for.\n\n\n\nMost of the answers seem to be trying to prove open source tools are better than Esri products! But that was not the question. Because it is difficult to compare a matured but expensive tool with a bunch of comparatively newer open source tools with great usability. My question is why no industry standard product from any established software giants? \n",

On the &quot;Style&quot; tab, the Render Type only offers the &quot;Singleband color data&quot; option, not the &quot;Multiband color&quot; option described in step 3.5 for typical rasters here.

Have a look at these questions:\n\n\nWhy do quickmapservices basemap labels shrink when printed?\nHow to increase label size of OpenLayers plugin basemap layers?\nSet scale level of background map (QGIS)\nQGIS - changing WMS / ArcGISMapServer Zoom level\nHow to make a map in Qgis with a background of google maps?\nHow can I show the details from the highest zoom of OSM webmaps in QGIS for printing?\n\n\nThis is a limitation of base layers from WMS services. They&#39;re rendered as tiles, which means that the size of the labels is baked into each zoom level. When you increase the resolution, the server provides you a more zoomed-in tile, which has: (1) higher resolution and (2) smaller labels. You can&#39;t get (1) without (2).\n\nOne workaround is to force the tileserver to give you the zoomed-out version of the tiles. The image will be slightly fuzzy/pixelated but the labels will be larger. There are two ways to do this:\n\n\nReduce the dpi of your export. This requires some trial and error to find the highest dpi that will still give you the higher zoom level.\nImport the WMS layer as an XYZ tile layer. The basemap will still have a low resolution, but the other elements in your map can have as high a resolution as you want.\n\nFirst, find and copy the service URL from the layer properties &gt; Information &gt; GetMapURL\n\n\n\nNext, open the Browser panel, right click on &quot;XYZ Tiles&quot; &gt; New Connection. Paste the URL you found before. Set the max zoom level, and give the layer a name like &quot;This Basemap max zoom 16&quot;. Import the layer from the browser.\n\n\n\nIt takes some trial and error to find the right maximum zoom level for the scale at which you&#39;re making maps. \n\n\nAnother workaround is to use a basemap without labels, and add the labels from another source. \n\n\nIf you search around, you may find a WMS basemap which is just label, so you can control the label size independently. For example, through the QuickMapServices plugin you can get a layer called &quot;ESRI Boundaries&amp;Places&quot; which has place names (cities, states, parks, natural features) and political boundaries, but no street names. \nOr you can manually add the labels you want. \n\n\nIt&#39;s a trade-off between the convenience of a pre-made basemap versus having control over every aspect of your map.\n",

Empirical evidence suggests that the limit of characters for a label is 2^15 - 8 = 32.760 characters - if pasted directly in the label field. If the label is based on an attribute, potential limits in the field length of the data format of the layer&#39;s source (file or database) apply.\nSee my screenshot, where I pasted a blindtext created in Word and counted as 17.016 characters (!). As you can see, the text displays as a label of the point in the bottom left of the map canvas.\nI also tried longer labels. An empirical value where QGIS clipped the text at the end was reached with 32.760 characters (near 32.768 = 2^15). So you could include a shorter term paper inside of a label text. That sayed means that the limitations are definitely more on the side of visualization, as MrXsquared already mentioned in his comment, than technical abilities of QGIS. QGIS is definitely able to display really very, very long labels.\nThe problem in your case has been another one (solved in anotoher answer). In any case, always make sure when using a field name as label if the data provider format has some limitations. I pasted the text directly with simple quotation marks : , thus not using the content of an attribute field. So we really speak here about label length, not lenght of field content - we have to clearly distinguish between them.\nWhat you also have to be aware of is line wrapping. Maybe when lines get too long (or when the labeled geometry feature is not visible on the map canvas) the label does not render. See this answer here: https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/381205/88814\n\nLabels of such a length are definitely not established practice - a label with 30 (!) characters is already characterized as &quot;very long&quot;:\n\nSometimes labels are very long, such as &quot;River of the Big Dry Blue\nReef&quot;\n\nIt would be interesting what you want to use such long labels for. Or is it just curiosity for the technical limitations of the feature?\nFor (dynamic) webmaps, anyway the placement of the labels changes with every zoom level (and panning), so I would use pop-ups, have a look at actions.\nFor print output, in Print Layouts and Reports, you have textfields at your disposal.\n",

However, export tries to &quot;translate&quot; your QGIS-project as good as possible to openlayers/leaflet, but many details (styling etc.) that work in QGIS will not be rendered in the same manner.

The Scale is the ratio of a particular distance on the map, to the same distance on the ground.\n\nBut when it comes to maps on screen, the same concept cannot be applied. Firstly different screens do not have the same pixel size. It might be that a 14 inch monitor and a 24 inch monitor could have the same resolution (in terms of pixels). Then comes the issue of dpi. An iOS device with retina display has a dpi several times that of my work-station monitor. So 1 cm on my screen might show a different distance than 1 cm on your screen.\n\nSo what does the scale of a map in digital cartography mean? What does it mean, when I see the scale of a map is 1:180,000 in ArcMap?\n\n\n\nAside\nThis question came about because of several ArcMap Documents I received from a client who publishes paper maps.\nThe paper map is published at 1:180,000, but at that scale the map looks terrible. It&#39;s only when I zoom in, does the map look good. With trial and error, I found that the map looks best on screen at about 3 times the scale, i.e. at 1:60,000\n",

            "body": "I decided to provide some information on which way I finally went for my tiled map service. Pure JavaScript and GeoJSONs weren&#39;t a solution, because I have to handle roughly 40k polygons and 33k points. So I went for tiling. Oh, and I still don&#39;t have a access to root server, so I can&#39;t set up GeoServer or something similar (wouldn&#39;t be financially feasible for a single client at the moment)\n\nAfter some researching and reading, I finally settled with OpenLayers (after some showcasing with GMaps). Eric Hazzard&#39;s great book &quot;OpenLayers 2.10&quot; (Packt Publishing, 2011) really, really helped me a lot because it also covers some JavaScript basics and debugging tips.\n\nI did all my vector data work in QGIS, of course, thats definitely the way to go for a small freelancer like me (I also know quite some ArcGIS stuff from university, but QGIS has been offering all I ever needed so far).\n\nStyling the map and creating the tiles was a bigger challenge. First, I went along with &quot;GMapCreator&quot; by CASA, but layering multiple shapefiles proved to be tedious (I have to provide point data over polygons, and then a municipal borderline enclosing everything). It is absolutely possible to do this in GMapsCreator (and I did it for the showcase stage), but it takes 3 full rendering cycles (first you create tiles, then the existing tiles get &quot;overdrawn&quot; with later features - rendering in the right order is important!), and the styling menus are slightly bulky and confusing. Saving your map and editing it later is also a complicated issue.\n\nTileMill seemed very promising, especially their CSS-like styling, so I looked into it. Unfortunately, it&#39;s Mac or Linux only, so that might scare some people off. I really liked what I saw, so I set up a Ubuntu partition on my hard-drive, downloaded it and styled my maps. Documentation on the styling syntax is sometimes a little scarce, but watching their demo video (linked on the main site) answers almost everything. It&#39;s possible to do some interesting stuff with nested and/or conditional styles, and some basic CSS understanding should really get you where you want to go.\n\nIn the end, TileMill renders a nice, single *.mbtiles file. I don&#39;t think there is a way to directly display these in OpenLayers (at least I couldn&#39;t find one?), so it was time to use another tool: mbutil. This tool &quot;unzips&quot; the mbtiles-File in to a regular folder structure containing the tiled pngs of my data on the selected zoom levels.\n\nFinally, I uploaded all these files to my FTP-Server, did some heavy reading on OL to get my webmap up and going (you add the created tiles as a TMS layer, but guessing the right source url and layer name took some time and googling) and then burned some hours fiddling around with basic html/CSS issues. I wanted a 100% width/height map with a floating legend  following my clients &quot;corporate&quot; (it&#39;s a municipality, as mentioned) identity guidelines.\n\nOh, and so far I use Google Maps as base layers, but that might get replaced soon by some custom aerial pictures served via WMS (not provided by me, but the state&#39;s survey and geodata administration).\n\nI hope I didn&#39;t forget anything important, but if I did, please feel free to ask! I&#39;ll check this thread occasionally.\n",

Is there a way to get a quality resampling without first converting to 24bit color?\nhow do I get gdalwrap or gdal_retile.py (or another utility) to align the generated tiles to the webmap grid (the world divided into 2^zoom tiles of equal lat-lon delta)? Right now my tiles are the right pixel size, but most likely not aligned to the lat-lon grid nor the zoom level\nthe tiles generated by gdal_retile.py are named according to each one&#39;s location in the source file, but I need to translate that to the global tile number for my zoom level. Do the tools support doing that on the fly, or do I need to post-process?\nusing gdal_retile.py with the -levels option generates sub-directories but the tiles therein are all black; I was expecting the zoomed out pyramid (and fewer tiles, not more, than the default level), should I be using a different option?\neven for this smallish sample, each command seems to take an inordinately long time, and this is on an octo-core MacPro and SSD. Is there a performance guide for GDAL?\n\n\nHere&#39;s what I have been doing, starting with the sx99.tif sample file:\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of gdal_retile.py, I&#39;ve tried using gdal2tile.py on the pre-warped raster maps.\n\nHowever, while the X coordinate for each of the generated tiles is correct, the Y coordinate seems to be at least double what I am expecting.\n\nI&#39;ve tried explicitly setting the source SRS and target profile, to no effect.\n\n\n\nI can&#39;t understand what&#39;s going wrong. The warped intermediate image looks OK:\n\n\n\nBut the resulting files are in the range of (for zoom level 11): 1003 &lt;= x &lt;= 1004 and 1359 &lt;= y &lt;= 1360, where I was expecting y around 780...\n",

However, I believe that this only works with WMTSes which add parameters to  requests as querystring variables in key=val pairs (eg http://www.provider.net/path?var1=val1&amp;var2=val2 etc). I need to add a WMTS which uses a URL path for its parameters (eg http://www.provider.net/path/val1/val2 etc). The WMTS in question is https://www.basemap.at/wmts/1.0.0/WMTSCapabilities.xml.\n\nThe way other clients handle this is by parsing the  URL, which provides the parameter mapping for  requests. I see that OpenLayers has a method for parsing  to add the WMTS (https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/wmts-layer-from-capabilities.html).\n\nI&#39;m aware that at least one other question has this as the underlying issue (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44300140/wmts-layer-syntax-for-leaflet), but it doesn&#39;t make it clear what the underlying problem is, so I thought it was worth asking a new question.\n\nI know that I can either read the  XML myself (or look at network requests from a working client) and determine the structure to add a plain XYZ tileserver.

This works fine for other projects.\nWhat the problem is:\nThe exported map loads extremely slow and the browser becomes unresponsive. The same is true for the plugin&#39;s preview. I  get the warning:\n\nA large number of features are present in the map. Generating the\npreview may take some time.\n\nI guess this is because it tries to load all 54.000 point features, even if only a small section of the whole extent is inside the current canvas extent. Scale based visibility apparently can&#39;t be converted by qgis2web plugin.\nWhat I tried:\nChanging the  setting in the plugin, but with no success. I also looked to the other settings of the plugin (check the  checkbox for the point layer), but they don&#39;t resolve the problem.\nI also tried splitting up the layer to several small layers, based on a grid. The problem persists. I guess that Leaflet/the Web site still tries to load all layers in the current canvas extent - so the site gets blocked before you even get the chance to zoom in.\nThe question:\nHow can this problem be solved so that I have a WebMap with OSM basemap + the point layer, loading in reasonable time (few seconds at max.)\nScreenshots:\n\n\n\n",

My task is to automate the process of plotting these points into a feature class and displaying them on a webmap for other non-GIS users to view. An example: I receive tabular info that has these two relevant pieces of information: \n\nStarting point: Breaker #113  (Which I know the location of, and touches an electric line segment)\nFault Location: 18.3 Miles\n\nIt is important to note that the line features that I must be working on have a commonly shared attribute, called &#39;lineGroup&#39;, but there are many touching line features or segments that may be in that lineGroup. After I select the first line feature that touches my starting point, I iterate recursively through each vertice and measure the distance between them. I keep a running total of the distance, and the code plots a point when it reaches the fault location. \n\nI can get my code to work fine when there is only a single line segment to iterate over, but my dataset contains many different line segments that I may have to iterate over to reach the fault distance. Also, there may be branches off of a line that head in a different direction. So I can potentially have multiple points plotted from one run of this script. \n\nHere is the code I currently have, which works well for a single line segment. What I need help with is how to continue onward with the function when I hit the end of the first line segment, as well as how to branch off and find a possible fault location down a branch. \n\n\n",

            "body": "The quirky behaviours described by the questioner can be explained from the QGIS source codes. Here they are in simplified pseudocodes, with details omitted for clarity.\n\n\n\nWe will refer to the above in subsequent descriptions.\n\n(Nominal) Scale and Magnifier\n\nThe relationship between the Scale value and Magnifier value is\n\n\n\nIn the question, when Scale=1:125K and Magnifier=200%, the actual or effective scale used by QGIS was 1:62.5K. (Hence, the User was not looking at 1:125K.)\n\nQGIS&#39;s map view, at 1:125K loads Level 13 of the webmap service. But at 1:62.5K, QGIS loads Level 14. \n\nOversampling and Raster Layer\n\nAs explained in another answer, Oversampling is a limiter (pseudocode Line 2). It limits toUseRatio, which is a coefficient for amount of pixels to be read from the raster layer (i.e., resWdith and resHeight in pseudocode Line 4 and 5.) \n\nIf User specifies 0.0, then resWdith and resHeight will be zeroes, and nothing will be read from the raster layer. This explains the blank visual output described by the questioner.\n\nA raster layer backed by a file usually has only one &quot;layer&quot;, with a fixed native pixel resolution. (Note: Overlays omitted to simplify explanation.) QGIS loads the same layer for every map view, and scales up or down to produce the desired visual output. (Pseudocode Line 6 and 7.)\n\nNow, for a raster layer backed by a multi-layer webmap service, something interesting happened in Line 6. Based on the inputs (i.e., current map view extent, resWidth and resHeight), QGIS computes and loads the layer that supposedly gives the best pixel resolution. And this &quot;best&quot; layer is not necessarily the same layer computed by the effective (nominal) Scale.\n\nHence, at Scale=1:62,500 and Oversampling=2.0 (remember that OverSampling is not the actual coefficient but a limiter), QGIS loads Level 14. At Scale=1:62,500 and Oversampling=3.0, QGIS loads Level 15 (which happens to be the last layer, i.e. the layer with supposedly highest pixel resolution).\n\nAdditional Info\n\nThe ArcGIS Online USA Topo Maps webmap service actually has 16 layers and not three. Each layer has its own native pixel resolutions (i.e., &quot;scales&quot;). Hence, all GIS apps will look at it as having 16 layers - not three. The layer compositions are as below:\n\n\n\n(I suspected that Layer 12 to 15 may contain Topo! 1:100K content for areas not covered by Topo! 1:24K. Clarification on this is welcomed.) \n\nThe nominal scale of the map (i.e., 1:100K, 1:24K, and etc is true only on printed paper) and it is not to be confused with the pixel resolution of a digital map layer.\n\nIn the questioner&#39;s description, he observed that when Scale=1:125K and Magnifier=200% and Oversampling=2.0, QGIS shows GTopo 1:100K and not GTopo 1:24K. This may be due to (1) some tiles not successfully loaded during testing,\nor (2) User was looking at an extent where Topo! 1:24K does not cover and it was filled by content from Topo! 1:100K, or (3) QGIS on Mac uses a slightly different set of screen metric constants. (My apology as I had not gotten that far in the QGIS source codes.)\n",

At that time mapserver was faster/better both in performance and dev time. Reading various conversations here and there on the web indicate things are much improved with ArcGIS Server. The open source side has seen even more activity; from a distance the relative balance looks much the same. In any case web facing maps and services have never been ESRI&#39;s strong suite, as much as one can do with arcgis server now, it pales in comparison to the desktop tools. They&#39;re pumping boatloads of energy into arcgis server though so this may change eventually.\n\nDesktop development - this is modeller and the command line interface, followed by cleaning up and extending the saved scripts from that (but many never find the need to go that far). With modeller the initial design &amp; protoyping phase is a snap as one drags and drops compponents and defines relationships and dependencies between the processes. The model is not just conceptual, not just a picture. It&#39;s a tool that can be saved and re-used on real data at will. \n\nTurn on the CLI and run the canned toolboxes at will. As the tools run the actual commands executed and their parameters are reported. These reports can be copied to a text editor or spreadsheet, tweaked as desired, and pasted back into the CLI for execution. The CLI is also interactive, showing possible commands to choose from as one types, with tooltips for possible parameters, and accepts drag-n-drop from the various arcmap/catalog panels.\n\nDesktop development in ArcGIS is fast, largely intuitive, and well integrated. (I do have a looong list of desired improvements and gripes mind you!)\n\nReal development - this is firing up Visual Studio or [insert-favourite-IDE] and building something direct from ArcObjects in C#, C++, Java, Python, etc. I can&#39;t speak to how developing in this environment compares to other GIS platforms as I&#39;ve not done it. My hunch is that it has the perception of being more difficult because the number of possible objects to choose from is damnably large. I&#39;ve been told the ESRI COM library is the largest in the world, bigger than anything even Microsoft has built. That&#39;s going to take some time to get the gist of.\n",
